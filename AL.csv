Abukuma,The most important thing is that everyone stays safe.,24
Acasta,Is there something on my face?,25
Acasta,Hmm? Not very talkative? *Yawn* I guess it's because I'm always so sleepy,25
Acasta,Wha? Guess I fell asleep. With weather this fine I couldn't help it,26
Acasta,Zzzzz Ugh I'm trying to sleep don't poke me like that,26
Acasta,Uhh if anyone sees us you'll get arrested.,27
Acasta,Maybe you should take a look at the mission log?,27
Acasta,*Yawn* Maybe the rewards are here now,28
Acasta,Got some mail Wonder if it's for you.,28
Acasta,Welcome back *Yawn* Guess I'm a little sleepy,29

Acasta,Everyone calm down. Seize the chance and hit the enemy where it hurts.,30
Acasta,We won. Well at least I didn't make a fool of myself I guess.,30
Acasta,I figure this outcome isn't something to celebrate,31
Acasta,Guess I should put in a little more effort?,31
Acasta,Keep it down will you,32
Acasta,I just can't be bothered Maybe I should go to sleep,32
Acasta,I'm not all that talkative but we don't even need words to understand each other do we?,33
Acasta, Sorry I'm just so happy that I don't even know what to say I'll take good care of this,33
Acasta,Hey wanna eat this Valentine's chocolate with me? I'd feel anxious thinking about when you're gonna eat it so enjoying it together with you could ease my mind maybe,34
Acasta,You don't need to eat this chocolate right now just call me over when you feel hungry. I wanna see how happy it makes you and memorise your look to motivate me in the future Hmm I think I taste-tested too much and now I'm getting food coma Zzzzz,34
Acasta,I'm excited about this day since my chocolate always makes you so happy. But I also had to get up early to make it so I'd appreciate it if you could take it now so I can go to bed,35
Acasta,I just can't be bothered even after retrofitting,35
Acasta,I'm dressing differently but you're still just as nice to me Thank goodness,36
Acasta,*Yawn* Nobody'll see me yawning if I cover it up with my turret I think,36
Acasta,Hm? Guess we're both about to head out Don't stare at me like that Even I go outdoors sometimes Since we're both uh headed the same way maybe we could walk there together?,37
Acasta,Even I go on these fashionable outings They do wear me out though,37
Acasta,I always bring some weapons with me in case I'm needed for a sudden sortie I guess.,38
Acasta,Recently I've gotten a lot of compliments like see a little fashion could make you cute after all *Sigh* it feels kinda odd I guess,38
Acasta,*Sigh* Maybe I should swap back to my old clothes,39
Acasta,Uhh something might blow up if you poke me so casually.,39
Acasta,I heard you're supposed to hang lanterns up everywhere during the Spring Festival so Ardent and I gave it a try! What do you think? Pretty cute right? Um I was talking about the lanterns,40
Acasta,It was no easy feat hanging up all these lanterns Make sure to take it all in okay?,40
Acasta,These red strips hanging from the lanterns? They're probably riddles of some sort? The Dragon Empery sure knows how to put on some interesting events,41
Acasta,Zzzz Shoot I dozed off *sigh* It's already this late,41
Acasta,I wonder if this outfit brings out my girlish side,42
Acasta,What a gentle glow I think I'm getting sleepy,42
Acasta,Looking after rabbits is a lot more enjoyable than running around doing errands There might be something therapeutic about looking after these cuties,43
Acasta,If you don't get out of that teacup I won't be able to pour the tea,43
Acasta,As soon as I touch these cute little bunny ears Haau it's cuteness overload,44

Admiral_Graf_Spee,No matter how poor the odds are I will always head for the battlefield. That way people will admire me.,57
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Wars don't exist for mindless slaughter they exist for victory.,57
Admiral_Graf_Spee,One's first battle being their last That sort of thing isn't all that unusual for us Iron Blood ships.,58
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Give talking to people a try? I've always been alone so what am I supposed to talk about,58
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Once we've been assigned a mission we must complete it no matter what it is.,59
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I see that unlike me in the past you actually finished your mission.,59
Admiral_Graf_Spee,This letter Thank goodness it has nothing to do with Renown.,60
Admiral_Graf_Spee,A commission has been completed? That means they weren't ambushed. Thank goodness.,60
Admiral_Graf_Spee,So this is power,61
Admiral_Graf_Spee,For the honor and prosperity of Iron Blood and for even greater glory!,61
Admiral_Graf_Spee,How long will this victory actually last,62
Admiral_Graf_Spee,We've lost But I'm not giving up! It's not over yet!,62
Admiral_Graf_Spee,In the name of all that is dear to me!,63
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I have to hold out just a little longer!,63
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I sailed alone fought alone and sunk alone Although I am who I am didn't I still contribute to Iron Blood's cause?,64
Admiral_Graf_Spee,These hands are for grasping victory Even though I will never again be able to hug the people important to me what's done is done.,64
Admiral_Graf_Spee,No matter how much I fight I can't fill the void in my heart And being away from you is the reason why,65
Admiral_Graf_Spee,There's a note from Spee. It says I don't want to ask people for more help than I need so I made this chocolate all by myself. You Deutschland and my friends are all so kind to me but Valentine's is a special occasion so only you get this gift. Thanks for being here for me. From Spee.,65
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Eugen taught me how to use makeup but does it actually make me look pretty?,66
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I'm trying hard to learn about everyday things. Living a normal life is not so simple compared to fighting,66
Admiral_Graf_Spee,My pantyhose? Ajax gave me them as an enrollment gift I examined them very thoroughly and didn't find anything weird but I doubt they're just a normal pair of stockings,67
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Viersechs doesn't like picture books? I see Everyone else in the Z-class seems to like them though,67
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Hipper? Want some snacks? I get it. Not really means yes in your dictionary. Okay say aah.,68
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Deutschland? Could you stop using your megaphone to shout people who harass the girl with my phone will be expelled It's embarrassing and more importantly it's really distracting,68
Admiral_Graf_Spee,You're making me angry.,69
Admiral_Graf_Spee,This mail it's not another one of Ajax's pranks is it?!,69
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Don't go around disturbing the girls at the academy.,70
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Can I count on you?,70
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I'm so glad that I can finally practice cooking! I want to give something back to all the kindhearted people here!,71
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Ajax You're not pulling my leg this time are you?,71
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Hipper is a totally different person on the internet compared to how she is in real life. Maybe she just has trouble expressing herself around people she cares about,72
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Miss Illustrious could you teach me how to make tea? Admiral Hipper invited me to a tea party between the Royal Navy and Iron Blood but I've never brewed tea before,72
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Thanks to Juustagram even people like me who aren't very sociable can still chat with everyone Oh look Graf Zeppelin just made a new post!,73
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Prinz Eugen is surprisingly clumsy with this kind of stuff. She's still chicken-pecking with one finger.,73
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Welcome back! Cellphones are totally amazing aren't they? No matter where we are we can contact each other with the press of a button!,74
Admiral_Graf_Spee,To protect everyone who has shown me so much kindness I won't let you take a step closer!,74
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I knew it this totally reduces my fighting capabilities,75
Admiral_Graf_Spee,So this is where you were. There are so many people in the hall and I was worried about what I'd do if I'd lost you,75
Admiral_Graf_Spee,A ballroom dance? Sorry but I don't really know how to I just need to follow your steps? O-okay then I could give it a try.,76
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Ajax She's not planning something weird for the party is she?,76
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Everyone here is having so much fun I could never even imagine my past self being at a place like this.,77
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I know the party is still going on but you still have to check your new mail.,77
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Not everyone in the Royal Navy is like Ajax. I can actually have a productive conversation with most of them,78
Admiral_Graf_Spee,I will not let you disrupt the party for everyone else!,78
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Thanks to all the friends I have now I don't feel lonely anymore. And my encounter with you might be the happiest moment of my life. Ahahah~,79
Admiral_Graf_Spee,My sister just wouldn't stop bugging me so I finally caved and agreed to do this Anyways all I have to do is get up on stage and sing right?,79
Admiral_Graf_Spee,My sister's always pushing this for the glory of Iron Blood stuff onto me. Can't she do this idol stuff herself?,80
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Um Maybe it's because I'm so used to working with everyone but I feel like it's actually pretty easy being onstage.,80
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Idols are there to make people smile I never thought I could do something like that.,81
Admiral_Graf_Spee,These hands are no longer weapons of war but for returning the admiration of my fans. Right I can do this!,81
Admiral_Graf_Spee,We're not done with the lesson yet,82
Admiral_Graf_Spee,Have we been spending too much time on idol lessons?,82
Admiral_Hipper,Idiot so you rolled out of bed? Haah? What are you fantasizing about? I only happened to bump into you while patrolling the port.,83
Admiral_Hipper,What are you looking at idiot? Get out of my room!,83
Admiral_Hipper,Hah? A novice like you wants to challenge my cruiser-commanding skills?,84
Admiral_Hipper,Huh? Did I give you permission to touch me?,84
Admiral_Hipper,Don’t get distracted in the middle of a mission you idiot!,85
Admiral_Hipper,Idiot! Hurry up and collect your rewards! Why are you showing it off to me?,85
Admiral_Hipper,Are you too stupid to realize that you have new mail?,86
Admiral_Hipper,Idiot! If you had already returned why didn’t you come to see me? Hah? Who would be worried about you?,86
Admiral_Hipper,You idiot! You still haven’t remembered what you forgot about yet?,87
Admiral_Hipper,Hah? Did you think something like this would impress me?,87
Admiral_Hipper,Hmph. Just today I shall allow you to praise me a little.,88
Admiral_Hipper,C-c-c-curses! I can’t stand this ahh!,88
Admiral_Hipper,Huh? Who gave you permission to resist?,89
Admiral_Hipper,You piece of trash! I told you to stay out of my sight!,89
Admiral_Hipper,Huh? You can’t even do something like that? Are you an idiot?,90
Admiral_Hipper,Huh? Worried about me? Having an idiot like you worry about me doesn’t make me happy at all.,90
Admiral_Hipper,Huh? Who would ever have a crush on you? I’m only tagging along because Eugen wanted to have dinner with you. Don’t get the wrong idea idiot!,91
Admiral_Hipper,Huh? Who would ever fall in love with you? I’m only here to drop off something I found during sortie per regulations. Huh?! A ring? Who would wear something like that?!,91
Admiral_Hipper,Huh? Why must I wear something like this? Whatever I’m in a good mood for a change. You’re going to take care of me forever? Hmph! Isn’t that what you’re supposed to do?,92
Admiral_Hipper,Huhhh? Why would I go out of my way to get chocolate for you? I just happened to make too much and have leftovers and this is just so it doesn't go to waste! Don't get the wrong idea!,92
Admiral_Hipper,Here you go your long-awaited Valentine's chocolates. What? Even though you were making a really expectant face before now that I've made you some why are you giving such a weak reaction? Stop irritating me! Just take it already you big dummy!,93
Admiral_Hipper,Don't look at someone like that when they're trying to give you chocolate on Valentine's Day! I worked so hard to make them after all They're so well made it feels like a waste to eat them? Too bad for you then!!!,93
Admiral_Hipper,Happy Valentine's. Have this What's with that cocksure you made chocolate for me didn't you look? Yeah well you're wrong! This is I mean can't you tell? I know what you want 'cause I see you around port every single day. Maybe you'd know what I want if you were closer to me huh?!,94
Admiral_Hipper,Here it's your Valentine's chocolate. What's your deal? Every year you try and fail to get under my skin. Give it a Why would you eat it right in front of me?! Ugh shut up! I don't need a review of what's so good about it!,94
Admiral_Hipper,W-well? Does this kimono look good on me? R-really? Duh I know it looks GREAT on me! Who really cares what you think C-can't be me No I didn't say anything!,95
Admiral_Hipper,Which onsen do you want to go to today? I'd like to visit as many as possible so I can tell Eugen and the others all about the fancy places we've been to.,95
Admiral_Hipper,I can feel your gaze you know Would you stop ogling me like a painting? Huh?! You can't take your eyes off me? You say the stupidest damn things!,96
Admiral_Hipper,I've heard this type of kimono is famous. Makes sense considering how much skill an artisan needs to create patterns and colors this complex.,96
Admiral_Hipper,It's wonderful feeling the breeze on your skin after getting out of the hot spring. It's so soothing so cooling. You know what I mean right?,97
Admiral_Hipper,Hmph! Eugen can poke fun at me all she wants – this is NOT a date! She's not gonna be so smug when I gloat about how great the hot springs were. It was sooo good! I left feeling like a new person and so on!,97
Admiral_Hipper,Huh?! Grabbing a girl's hand without warning is a great way to startle her! At least tell me first!,98
Admiral_Hipper,Yeah I figured you'd like the pattern of– What the–?!,98
Admiral_Hipper,I don't care what spots you want to check out focus on your damn missions! You're keeping ME waiting too remember?!,99
Admiral_Hipper,Whoop-de-doo you finished a mission. Good for you. Stop dawdling and go collect the rewards!,99
Admiral_Hipper,There's a letter for you. Wow that's a nice postcard Never mind that just read what it says already!,100
Admiral_Hipper,Whew we're back. Time to dig in to some food before heading back to the onsen. You're worn out and I'm just as worn out as you are!,100
Admiral_Hipper,Let me guess you still haven't realized what's escaped your memory? Wrong! It's the commission not which stores I want to visit!,101
Admiral_Hipper,Isn't this much to be expected?,101
Admiral_Hipper,Thanks for making me work up a sweat!,102
Admiral_Hipper,We won. Heh I'm willing to give you the credit for the victory today.,102
Admiral_Hipper,This isn't much of a story to tell the others Ugh!,103
Admiral_Hipper,For the record I never wanted to go here. This trip is for you – to reward all your hard work and give you a break Huh? Me enjoying my time with you? Wh-who decided it's got anything to do with you? I have the right to enjoy my visit irrespective of you!,103
Agano,Though supporting from behind the lines is easy doing so for long periods makes me grow tired of it,104
Agano,These documents are for me Hm? That's unusual? I like to keep business and pleasure separate you see.,104
Agano,I went ahead and sorted out the new mission documents.,105
Agano,Are you sure this isn't a love letter from that girl you know? *Giggle*,105
Agano,Please have faith in the skill of this Agano-class light cruiser.,106
Agano,Let's give it everything we have.,106
Agano,Did you witness my performance?,107
Agano,How careless of me I will undergo special training when we've returned. *Giggle*.,107
Agano,They don't call me state of the art for nothing~,108
Agano,Dear me it seems things have gotten rather serious.,108
Agano,I wonder what will happen today *Giggle* I'm looking forward to finding out.,109
Agano,There will be no teasing from me today – only chocolate. Here. You understand what it means to receive chocolate right? It means I really like you. Say could I come a little closer? It's quite chilly out today,109
Agano,Even though I'm not really into this whole Christmas thing if it means I get to toy around with your heart by wearing this cute outfit of mine then I suppose I would be interested. Hehe~,110
Agano,Oh aren't you back early? May I suggest starting with a review of today's schedule?,110
Agano,Oh my it appears my costume has caused an unintended development,111
Agano,I'd like to offer you a reward for working so diligently even on a day as special as this.,111
Agano,Hey are you here by yourself? Hehe. Why don't we have a little chat then?,112
Agano,You haven't had anything to eat? If you'd like you can have some of my crepe~,112
Agano,Um do you mind if I shift a bit closer to you? It's a bit chilly out here What am I after? Jeez way to spoil the mood,113
Agano,Would you mind telling me more about yourself? I feel like we have a lot in common~ Hehe in other words I want to learn a lot more about you!,113
Agano,All done with the mission? Did you also pick up a crepe for me? Thanks a lot~,114
Agano,More mail huh You're quite the popular one. Hmph~,114
Agano,You must be tired right? Here if you'd like you can come lie down over here.,115
Agano,The competition tonight is considerably fiercer than I anticipated This calls for a counterattack Oh it was nothing important. I was just thinking out loud about how uh fabulous that chandelier is.,115
Agano,Come to think of it I haven't seen Noshiro around Knowing her she may be off on her own somewhere,116
Akagi,Don’t make fun of me for being slow-footed. See? I’ve~ caught~ you~,116
Akagi,If you so desire I would not mind if you partake of me in front of all the others.,117
Akagi,A new mission is another opportunity to deepen our bonds. *giggles*,117
Akagi,My love is invincible! Ahaha ahahaha!,118
Akagi,Ahahaha! I’m getting excited!,118
Akagi,We were destined to meet. I knew at first sight that you were the one I’ve been looking for my whole life.,119
Akagi,I have waited an eternity for this day to come. No one shall be able to separate us ever again! My mind body and soul belong to you as yours all belong to me. Haha ahahahaha!,119
Akagi,We should send out even more invites This is the best way to rid ourselves of those pesky vixens all at once!,120
Akagi,As long as we can be together those commissions and tasks don’t really matter right? You agree with me don’t you?,120
Akagi,Oh my mail has arrived. Mm it would seem that our superiors don’t suspect a thing.,121
Akagi,Relax Kaga. You're my only friend. You'll always have a place by my side.,121
Akagi,Has the commission fleet returned? If you're going won't you take Akagi with you?,122
Akagi,Ahaha Akagi is always ready and willing~,122
Akagi,I will not do anything that would tarnish your reputation but if any meddlesome pests insisted on getting in your way Ehehe,123
Akagi,Indeed. While you were socializing I made sure to strengthen our bonds with the other factions. At events like these Shinano is horribly out of place and if I may say so the burden may be a bit too great for Nagato.,123
Akagi,Who will you send to greet the commission fleet?,124
Akagi,1st CarDiv Akagi sallying forth~,124
Akagi,My love shall burn everything away~ Ahahahaha!!,125
Akagi,At least protect my friends and compatriots!,125

Akagi,Tonight you are not allowed to meet with anyone other than me. Exchanging pleasantries? Oh are you not satisfied with exchanging pleasantries with Akagi alone? Hehehe~,126
Akagi,Oh would you look who showed up Do remember to be on your best behavior tonight 5th~ Car~ Div~,127
Akagi,This reward shall serve as an exquisite dessert to the banquet~,127
Akagi,The commission team has returned? Excellent. You may go now.,128
Akagi,I shall burn everything away!,128
Akagi,Shall we take a break? There's no rush; your journey is far from over. Of course I couldn't be happier about that,129
Akagi,Oh you'd like to feed me? Okay! Aah,129
Akagi,A letter Heehee perhaps it's from a girl who's jealous of our relationship?,130
Akagi,I've gotten word that the commission team is back. Yes I'll arrange for someone to meet them. We wouldn't want to busy you over that now would we?,130
Akatsuki,T-the reason I sleep with the lights on is because i-it is not because I am afraid!,131
Akatsuki,Sometimes I do not understand what Ikazuchi and Inazuma are trying to say,131
Akatsuki,Can Hibiki find her way here on her own? It has me somewhat worried,132
Akatsuki,W-w-what! Anyone would be shocked from suddenly seeing a person's shadow cast in the light in the middle of the night!,132

Akatsuki,Damn I-I shall get you next time,137
Akatsuki,O darkness be gone!,138
Akatsuki,I am a little worried about Ikazuchi and Inazuma,138
Akatsuki,I cannot sleep well without my sisters by my side T-that is not to say I am lonely! I-it is because I am concerned about them!,139
Akatsuki,A promise that binds us for eternity I understand! Then I shall show you my true right eye right this mo T-there is no need for it? All I need to do is close my eyes instead? Re really?,139
Akatsuki,In an effort to put my ninja techniques to good use I have made this hyorogan-styled chocolate for you. Eat this and your belly will be filled for a full day! Hibiki and the others could never accomplish this! Hah hah!,140
Akatsuki,Hibiki I won't let myself get lost over something like that ever again!,140
Akatsuki,Is this the place called the Northern Parliament?! It is colder than I thought Th-thank goodness I brought gear for extreme environments! Hibiki please wait a bit longer! Your sister is coming to see you!,141
Akatsuki,Being fully prepared is the key to going in the right direction! Say that again? The East lies *that* way?,141
Akatsuki,I've still not found Hibiki I really do wonder when we'll meet again.,142
Akatsuki,It is thanks to my compass that I have arrived at the Northern Parliament! Huh? How long has the needle been frozen in place?!,142
Akatsuki,I'm curious as to how Ikazuchi and Inazuma are faring,143
Akatsuki,Would you care to harken to one of my tales of valor?,143
Akatsuki,Oooh I feel myself warming up! I don't know why though Something about it feels strange.,144
Akatsuki,To one day find Hibiki – that is the reason I set out upon this journey!,144
Akatsuki,My companion and I have shared so many miles together Hm maybe next time I should call my cohorts to take her for a spin together!,145
Akatsuki,My companion's lights are strong indeed but I still find these night roads rather difficult,145
Akatsuki,Back before I had broken her in my companion here gave me a lot of trouble. But these days? We move as one and the same!,146
Akatsuki,Inazuma and Ikazuchi are going to be impressed with my companion!,146
Akatsuki,Wooooaaaahh!! I'm losing control!,147
Akatsuki,My bond with my companion has grown even deeper!,147
Akatsuki,This obstacle will be child's play if I'm able to leverage my ninja skills I-I'm going the right way this time I'm sure of it!,148
Akatsuki,I'm well acquainted with how to use a grappling hook! What? Oh no! The presents!,148
Akatsuki,Hibiki will deliver the remaining presents? Phew that's good to know,149
Akatsuki,C-careful lest the rope come loose!,149
Akatsuki,I could've sworn we met here just a minute ago Wait a-am I going in circles?!,150
Akatsuki,The commission team has returned! Speaking of Where did my presents for them go?,150
Akatsuki,No ambushes! Let us fight face to face!,151
Akatsuki,I m-must maintain my posture!,151
Akatsuki,I see So it's called a performance not an exhibition Be that as it may the show must go on!,152
Akatsuki,Inazuma's elephant is quite the clever fellow. Heehee let us see if it can catch this ball!,152
Akatsuki,Ikazuchi are you all right?! Phew Don't make your sister worry like that!,153
Akatsuki,Behold! Jutsu of Flame Escape! *cough cough*! This darned pyrotechnic device is needlessly complicated!,153
Akatsuki,Don't just stand there Hibiki – come and assist! Your anchor really contains a hidden camera?! You just made that up? Aghh! Hibikiiii!,154
Akatsuki,H-hands off!,154
Akatsuki,A mission you say? It shall serve as a fine side act!,155
Akatsuki,I shall dance around our foes!,155
Akatsuki,My ninjutsu is no mere acrobatic act it's authentic! At least I'm fairly sure it is!,156
Alabama,I'd like to have a Turkey Shoot. Makes me wish I could fly,156
Alabama,You're interested in my abs? Go ahead and feel 'em.,157
Alabama,I can see the commission fleet comin' back over the horizon. Mhm I'm real proud of my eyesight!,157
Alabama,I feel like I could beat someone up right now Mmh!,158
Alabama,I won't let y'all leave until I've had my fun!,158
Alabama,Time to retreat? Fine,159
Alabama,Don't die on me just yet!,159
Alabama,Well well aren't you the frisky bunch Ahaha!,160
Alabama,Who the hell are you?,160
Alabama,I've been gettin' along pretty well with the Sakura Empire girls. I thought they'd hold a grudge against me but turns out that wasn't the case at all. Mhm they're an interestin' bunch!,161
Alabama,Chocolate's just too darn good so I wound up eatin' some while makin' it. This here's what's left It's all I've got so savor every bite.,161
Alabama,Thank you for always letting me cling to you. I made all of this just for you so please enjoy it. Oh you want to split it evenly with me? Yay~ *nom* Oh does this mean I can keep using you as a pillow?,162
Alabama,I feel it's weird to divvy up stuff into portions for each of us. What I want is to eat a single thing with you plain and simple. Reckon we could do that? Aw thanks. Hope we can keep doin' it like this forever.,162
Albacore,This? This is how I've always looked. Do ya like it? Let me guess you're having naughty thoughts aren'tcha~?,163
Albacore,I wonder what'd happen to you if I were to scream for help right now Wanna find out? Heheheh~,163
Albacore,Give me a massage and I'll keep quiet about that time you slacked off~,164
Albacore,Sweet mission rewards! So when am I getting my share?,164
Albacore,You've got mail! Say pretty please and I'll give it to you~,165
Albacore,Weeelcome back!  Why's the paperwork been stacked into a pyramid? Gee a strong wind must've done it~!,165
Albacore,Commission complete! C'mon let's go! We can't just sit here and keep 'em waiting forever!,166
Albacore,Ooh! That's good!,166
Albacore,Who's it gonna be next~? Teehee,167
Albacore,Hah hah! Easy peasy!,167
Albacore,Time to get outta heeeere!,168
Albacore,Surpriiiiiiiise!,168
Albacore,Huh? Have they spotted me or something?,169
Albacore,Jeeeeeeerk!,169
Albacore,You wonder what'd happen if you tick me off? I'd host something like a public exhibit of your greatest blunders!,170
Albacore,My shoulders are so stiff after a long day of swimming Oh I have an idea! If a certain someone gives me a massage I might just forget that really embarrassing thing they did!,170
Albacore,It's mean to mess with you all the time so today you'll get a nice relaxing massage!  *Phew* Hey you feeling something inside your ears? It's your fault for blindly trusting me like that!,171
Albacore,H-hey listen If some day I don't come back from the battlefield would you Ahahaha! Like that's ever happening! C'mere! I'm gonna tickle you senseless!,171
Albacore,Just claiming my ring. If that's all then I'm gonna get going now What? You're not gonna stop me? I-I'm telling ya I really will walk outta here!  Fiiiine you win! I admit it I just can't be without you anymore!,172
Albacore,Go on guess who this Valentine's chocolate is from~ Here's a hint: she worked her butt off to make it and really wants you to have it! So who made it? Get it wrong and I'll call Taihou and her obsessive friends over~,172
Albacore,Here's your cut in chocolate form my partner in crime! Cut for what? Oh nothin'! Jokes aside: Taihou and I made chocolate together~ She'll probably stuff you like a turkey with hers later so it's probably a good idea to get used to the taste!,173
Albacore,You had a great reaction that time I leapt at you out of a box so I wanted to replicate that with a box of chocolates but alas Taihou stopped me. Shaaame Oh well instead I hid my chocolates among the pile you've received already. If you can figure out which are mine you may just win a special prize~!,173
Albacore,How about a KAPOW! Gave you a real scare didn't I? Teehee~ Turned out pretty good if I say so myself~,174
Albacore,You wanna warn people about my firecrackers? Hehehe~ By all means go ahead~ But how exactly are you gonna explain knowing that I had 'em hidden under my dress~? You get where I'm going with this don'tcha? Hehehe~,174
Albacore,Which do you like more: this dress or my ordinary getup? Why do I even ask? Hehehe~ C'mon don't be shy and answer the question~,175
Albacore,You're gonna dig up location info under the guise of dancing with someone? Hey pretty good idea! Huh? You just wanna dance? With me?,175
Albacore,I wonder how people would look at you if I set off a firecracker right now Wanna find out? Heheheh~,176
Albacore,L-listen I'm really grateful that you hang out and let me mess around with you! I've got something important to say Come here so I can whisper C'mon a little closer *smooch* Hah got 'em! Expect much more teasing to come~,176
Albacore,Surpriiiise! I was in the box all along! Did I really freak you out that much? Heehee~ Here have this voucher as an apology. Come see me later to use it~,177
Albacore,C'meown in! What can I get mew? The meows and mews are part of the theme mew see!,177
Albacore,Maybe I'll get Archerfish to hop in a box too. We can handle the wait but can you handle that many surprises~? Hehehe~,178
Albacore,I don't prank people while I'm on duty~ That is unless they're someone I like~,178
Albacore,The reason I'm just lounging around right meow is 'cause I've already taken everyone's orders~,179
Albacore,For every prank you fall for you get a minute of one-on-one chat time with me! Pretty sweet deal am I right?,179
Albacore,I wonder what'd happen if you touched other girls like you touch me Wanna find out? Heheheh~,180
Albacore,You like me so much you'll skip work just to see me? Heehee~ Golly look how these missions are piling up~,180
Albacore,Meow nice to see you! Teehee~ Popping outta the box never fails to get a reaction from you~,181
Albacore,The commission team is back? The next time you visit me bring some friends along!,181
Albacore,By the way! I've got a secret discount menu. If you wanna know the code phrase for it come closer so I can whisper it to you. Closeeer Mwah! That was all a lie! Thanks for being so easy to trick~,182
Albion,Light carrier Albion at your service. I await your orders.,182
Albion,You want to know about my appearance? Unlike Elder Centaur my name is not based on a mythological creature. If I had to say the land where those with my appearance lived in the ancient times when legends roamed the world Oh am I talking your head off?,183
Albion,If you require a change of pace I would like to suggest taking a stroll through the forest with Elder Centaur. I would especially recommend the forest by the hills as the wind there feels particularly nice. Hehehe.,183
Albion,The ships of my class use a variety of arms in battle so I don't think trying to copy their fighting style will be of much use to me. Instead I can learn from their battle-readiness.,184
Albion,Grey Ghost? I'm not sure I can shoulder the burden of sharing a nickname with Elder Enterprise I-if you're fine with it I do suppose you can call me that if you wish,184
Albion,U-um go ahead So long as you don't touch the rigging of my bow,185
Albion,H-how embarrassing Ugh,185
Albion,Let us work towards the completion of your missions. It is by following your example that we shipgirls reach new heights.,186
Albion,The rewards for your completed missions are here. Should I check the address to confirm whether they've arrived at the right place?,186
Albion,There seems to be some new mail Would you like to take a look?,187
Albion,The whispers of the wind tell me that the girls have returned from their commissions. Let me know when you're ready to meet with them.,187
Albion,With courage and loyalty we shall prevail!,188
Albion,The unblemished Albion thus claims this victory!,188
Albion,How did I manage to be so clumsy,189
Albion,Please watch what I can do my dear Elders!,189
Albion,I've got to dig my heels in I don't want to be a burden to my Elders!,190
Albion,Was there something amiss with the way I conducted myself?,190
Albion,As a Childe of the fleet I can only hope to learn from the examples my Elders set in battle as well as from how you manage the fleet. There is much for me to learn in terms of techniques mental attitude as well as everyday customs.,191
Albion,Hmm Perhaps I need a new way of addressing my Elders of the destroyer class And then there are the blueprint ships as well But they're still my Elders What should I do?,191
Albion,A Promise Ring? Um I don't recall ever asking for one though You're giving it to me because you love me? O-oh! Yes I see! I apologise for being so thick-skulled that I didn't have an inkling of your feelings for me. Ehehe thank you very much. ♥,192
Albion,While Elder Centaur tends to take after our other Elders and follow what they do I prefer to learn from them instead. Indeed I prefer using my brain just as you do.,192
Albion,If I could instruct the others in my unique fighting style we could perhaps implement new tactics in battle. It's certainly not because I want to be called an Elder myself or anything. Heehee.,193
Albion,Elder Enterprise really can do just about anything Though if there's any area I can exceed her in it's probably cooking housework or making my way through the forests like Centaur Um huh?,193
Albion,Phew It really does take lots of consistent effort to live up to my Elders' expectations. Nevertheless the unblemished Albion thusly claims this victory!,194
Albion,I-I apologise for making a fool of myself If it's alright with you can I tag along with you for a bit longer? I'm sure if I try hard enough I'll be able to step on you more satisfactorily But don't worry I'm just playing a role.,194
Albion,Shall I become a faerie a vampire or even a succubus? Hmm I wonder which of these do I see myself being?,195
Albion,Elder Vampire has taken me under her tutelage but it's quite difficult to walk in this outfit Oh I'd be just fine with you by my side though.,195
Albion,It feels quite awkward having to give you orders You know what? You should be the one ordering me around after all. Just say the word and it shall be done.,196
Albion,This outfit is a bit too tight around certain places Ugh,196
Albion,So this is what you're like when you've been seduced I'll have to keep this in mind Whew *blushes*,197
Albion,Impeccable results. Oh I suppose I should have a more condescending attitude towards you? Umm I suppose those were passable results?,197
Albion,A victory as unblemished as Oh I wonder if I can still say that in these black clothes I-in any case a victory is a victory!,198
Alfredo_Oriani,If you wanna know others' secrets you gotta give me something of equal value. Don't worry 'bout getting duped – I deal fair and square!,198
Alfredo_Oriani,Wherever you'll find scoops you'll find me! Heehee~,199

Alfredo_Oriani,Whuah! Dammit I didn't have time to snap an incriminating pic!,201
Alfredo_Oriani,What's this? You trying to score points with me?,201
Alfredo_Oriani,New missions? If we're talking quick errands I can do 'em!,202
Alfredo_Oriani,A confidential letter It'd make for a juicy story but top-secret stuff has to stay that way!,202
Alfredo_Oriani,Cheese! Welcome back! I snapped a photo of you and the fleet looking badass out there! It's gonna blow up in the news! In a good way! Heehee!,203
Alfredo_Oriani,The commission team is back! I'm gonna go snap some group photos!,203
Alfredo_Oriani,Nice! Lens aligned picture perfect!,204
Alfredo_Oriani,We're live so remember to look photogenic!,204
Alfredo_Oriani,First question: how does it feel to be the– Wait what? I'M the MVP?!,205
Alfredo_Oriani,I-I guess I'll hide this blunder at the back of the newspaper,205
Alfredo_Oriani,Smile for the camera!,206
Alfredo_Oriani,D-don't lash out at me just 'cause I'm a journalist!,206
Alfredo_Oriani,I-I-I'm so sorry! I'll stop with my journalism if it offends you! Just please show mercy!,207
Alfredo_Oriani,Just between you and me info about you is currently worth this much! Heheheh! Interested? Then lemme interview you some more~,207
Alfredo_Oriani,Hm? You like me? Ahahahah! I'm nobody special I'm just a smalltime journalist who loves gossip~ Forget about me – who else do you fancy? That's valuable information!,208
Alfredo_Oriani,You curious about another girl? I could look into her if you wa– Wait a sec! You better not be thinking about cheating on me!,208
Alfredo_Oriani,Huh. Turns out I've snapped a bunch of photos of you hard at work I'll make a solo exhibition out of these at some point! Huh? That's a no-go? Why?,209
Alfredo_Oriani,I forget I'm the name ship of my class all the time! Guess it's 'cause I'm kinda childish compared to the oldest sisters from other classes plus I'm a shortie Still you married me so that's gotta mean I have SOME unique charm!,209
Alfredo_Oriani,There's yesterday's combat report here's some random outdoors photos I took and this Ummm! Forget you saw that!,210
Alfredo_Oriani,H-hold your horses! I need to mentally prepare first!,210
Alfredo_Oriani,You know how to make a girl happy~ Heehee~,211
Alfredo_Oriani,Tadah! Heehee what'd ya think of my dance? I got advice from my Sardegnian friends on how to blend in with the crowd while gathering scoops! Although I may have gone a bit overkill with it,211
Alfredo_Oriani,GB! I snapped a bunch of photos of ladies being ladies! Here! Feel free to reference it~,212
Alfredo_Oriani,Aha! So I move my feet like Hang on why am I here learning dance moves from you?!,212
Alfredo_Oriani,I'm not hiding anything! There's nothing I CAN hide to begin with! Use your common sense!,213
Alfredo_Oriani,You typically ask for a dance by holding someone's hand not by patting their head,213
Alfredo_Oriani,A new letter? It might be a personal invitation for you! Let's find out!,214
Alfredo_Oriani,This is Alfredo reporting live on– Hey the battlefield's no place to fret over dresses!,214
Algérie,We're on great terms after all. I would've been fine waiting a bit longer.,215

Algérie,Shattering the confines of the treaty is rather pleasurable. Hehehe~,220
Algérie,It'd be nice if the battle goes the way we want it to.,221
Algérie,If only you realized the situation you were in a little sooner you might've been able to avoid this outcome but what can you do at this point?,221
Algérie,It's too late to run~,222

Algérie,Oh my hehe Are you enjoying the warmth of the sunlight here? I'm glad that you're finding some time to relax here but wouldn't you rather come play with everyone else?,229

Algérie,Here a sun cap. If you want to play out on the beach please make the proper preparations against the sun's rays first.,230

Amagi,Swineherds like you are quite hard to find these days.,251

Amazon,You are aware of what you're doing right! I-Is that so? Then I accept Don't misunderstand! This isn't for you but for the fleet!,266
Amazon,Here's your Valentine's chocolate! Just so you know I put a lot of work into making this! Also even if my chocolate-making skill is a bit lacklustre you're lacklustre in far more respects than that alone!,267
Amazon,It's Valentine's again rookie! Today you're going to learn how to make chocolate! Shape up and get into– What?! How are you mixing the ingredients like a pro?! You knew all along?!,267
Amazon,The way you made chocolate like a complete rookie last year is burned into my memory. *sigh* I'll just have to show you how it's done. It's like Köln said – Valentine's is a laborious time for us incredibly busy teachers. Be glad I'm setting some time aside just for you!,268
Amazon,Stop sleeping on the job already! Straighten your back eyes ahead! Sort yourself out!,268
Amazon,Hmm? Does my post-retrofit appearance interest you *that* much? How hopeless you are! Fine gaze upon me!,269
Amazon,Stop looking at me like I only got this far thanks to you!,269

An_Shan,Wow! Today's schedule looks packed. Let's work hard today!,274
An_Shan,Where did Fu Shun run off to? Would it really kill her to do as I say every now and then?,274
An_Shan,My sisters - Fu Shun Chang Chun and Tai Yuan - are all my pride and joy!,275
An_Shan,Hey-! My sisters are going to see us,275

An_Shan,So let's get going soon okay? I've also been really looking forward to today's date. Oh right whatever happens today you mustn't let my sisters know! If word gets out that I'm sneaking off or something things are going to get really troublesome!,280
An_Shan,There's a lot of work to get through today but it's nothing the two of us together can't handle!,280
An_Shan,You want to know more about the four of us huh? Fu Shun's a bit of a daredevil Chang Chun has too many great ideas and Tai Yuan should really put herself out there a bit more. Hm? Me? Well What do you think about me? Hehe~,281
An_Shan,Talking to the Gnevny-class girls really brings back old memories~,281
An_Shan,Fu Shun isn't up to some mischief again is she Hmm do you think I'm worrying a bit too much about my sisters?,282
An_Shan,Ehehe~ Urk No no more of that! I'm gonna float off to cloud nine!,282
An_Shan,Eek! Th-this is going to be a bad influence on my sisters if they see us,283
An_Shan,I'll show you what an all-rounder is capable of!,283
An_Shan,S-sometimes even I want to look cool in front of my sisters Ahem! Forget I said that!,284
An_Shan,Boundless is the beauty of evening's glow but alas–– Oh that doesn't have any special meaning I've just been hanging around Hai Tien too much. (*whispers*) But it's true Our time together is far too short just like the evening light,284
An_Shan,You put salty toppings into your milk tea? Even spicy things too? Th-that's heresy! You mustn't put anything into boba that would tarnish its flavor!,285
An_Shan,I wonder how my sisters are doing Oh right I've got to set that stuff aside when I'm with you.,285
An_Shan,Are you done with your drink already? Well you can have some of mine– Wait oh Um don't worry about it though! I'd hate for you to go thirsty! S-seriously I don't mind,286
An_Shan,The sunset sure is beautiful huh? Ahaha~,286

Aoba,I've made my fair share of mistakes so I thought I could help by leaving something to commemorate everyone's hard work. Sorry for saying something so unlike me but you made me drop my guard. Now you have to answer my questions!,306
Aoba,Alright I've decided. For all my precious friends here I will record their lives! Does that include you? Oh you don't you already know the answer to that?,307
Aoba,Just to be clear I'm not good at this kind of stuff so don't expect me to say anything romantic ever! Well maybe just once Um I l-l-love you!,307

Arashio,We all give chocolate to you for Valentine's Day but isn't this a great opportunity to make chocolates for our tea ceremonies as well? For some reason I feel like I'm not the only one with that idea. If it does pan out we're going to be able to have even more fun~,323
Arashio,The shimmering of fireworks reflected across the water's surface How enchanting and ephemeral,323
Arashio,Sparklers might not be as gorgeous as the fireworks that blossom in the sky but it's nice to be able to have something you can enjoy at your own pace.,324

Arashio,It's so quiet along the river bank You can even hear the soft crackling of fireworks.,325
Arashio,Eek Are you doing this because there are no people nearby?,325
Archerfish,A submarine's gotta take care of her skin if she goes diving a lot. Not much you can do about the tan though!,326

Archerfish,Got plans to go anywhere today? I might tag along and keep you company.,334
Archerfish,It feels soooo good to sneak between that sleeping fox's tails and floof them~ Though I'll admit it's not cool to disturb someone's sleep like that. Ahaha~,334
Archerfish,Here's some yummy soup for you made with lots of love! Teehee~ Wanna taste test it? All righty but what do you say we skip the spoon and have you lick it from my finger instead~?,335

Archerfish,Don't you start making excuses now! The drinks I served you were alcohol-free!,339
Archerfish,What's this drink Bluest Blue? Ah. The name alone makes it obvious Bluegill came up with it. It's just carbonated water on the rocks.,340
Archerfish,Would you look at that – we're sat next to each other in class. Looking forward to doing some extracurricular activities with you this term. Hehehe~,340
Archerfish,What you think my tail sticks out too much? I can just hide it like I usually do,341
Archerfish,I wonder what that sleepy fox is up to. Snoozing in the Napping Club's secret spot maybe? I think I'll pay her a little visit.,341
Archerfish,Being surrounded by cute girls day in and day out is no excuse for not paying attention in class. Your grades are gonna plummet if you don't focus~,342
Archerfish,What to do after school's out How 'bout we go around port holding hands? I bet the other girls would flip their lids if they saw that. Hehehe~,342
Archerfish,Anything I can do for or to you? Us adjacent classmates gotta help each other you know~,343

Ardent,I've finished organising the new missions. Don't forget to check them~!,361
Ardent,Acasta when you're giving out chocolate you have to lean up against the other person and whisper in their ear. Don't you think it's more heart-pounding that way?,362
Ardent,Ark Royal gave me some chocolate! Unlike Glorious she seems to be pretty good with her hands Ahah,362
Ardent,Did you want some chocolate? Mm okay. I'll go make some for you.,363

Argus,Zzzz Ah! Is it already time for work? Sorry for oversleeping I was so excited to be your secretary that I stayed up really late,377
Argus,The outfit I wore during our outing is right over here. I went ahead and ironed it so there's not a single wrinkle on it! Heheh maybe I'll wear it again next time we go out?,377
Argus,Ugh I hope these numbers are right. I'd be a failure of a secretary if I had to ask Langley and the others for help,378
Argus,If you're going out let me go with you! Why? Well We can call it a date! Teehee!,378
Argus,Would you like me to hold your hand and lead the way?,379

Argus,Yaaawn Umm did I doze off again? Oh no Organising school events gets so hectic I always end up working right up until curfew Just give me one more minute please,381
Argus,Hosting school events is really such a task. I've been so sleep deprived lately *yaaawn* No that's enough yawning. I still have work to do,381
Argus,Achoo! Thank you. Of course sleeping here all the time would lead to me getting a cold. I should be more careful,382
Argus,Implacable! You can play that game at home but you can't bring it to the festival! What do you mean why? A-aren't you embarrassed?!,382
Argus,Is it time for the next item on our schedule?,383
Argus,Whawha?!,383
Argus,There are still things to be done before the school festival Let's begin with these missions.,384
Argus,Costumes materials and printed materials are all done. I've contacted the commission team as well Things are really coming together. Phew,384
Argus,We won! None can rival the Royal Navy's glorious tradition!,385
Ariake,Though I sometimes wish Yuugure would be a little more independent thinking about that feels a bit lonely.,385
Ariake,Looks like we've got new missions. Any transport operations? Those are my specialty~,386
Ariake,Come to think about it Yuugure always has to tell me whenever she finishes a mission,386
Ariake,Take care of your anti-air~!,387
Ariake,Everyone be on the lookout for enemy airstrikes!,387
Ariake,MVP huh? I'm satisifed as long as I was able to help~,388
Ariake,I wouldn't mind resting up in the docks if not for this whole getting beat up thing,388
Ariake,Now's our chance.,389
Ariake,Things are getting a little messy,389
Ariake,Ariake-class? Ah! There was something like that at some point but it was changed back later not that I mind. What about Yuugure? Well,390
Ariake,Having taken care of Yuugure Shiratsuyu and sometimes even Shigure for such a long time I can't just flip the switch so easily and become clingy and dependent myself,390
Ariake,See super-domestic little sisters are in high demand right now! But I will admit it's a little embarrassing~ Hehe From now on you can depend on me even more. I'm very confident in my skills~,391
Ariake,Aww isn't Unicorn adorable with her little sister act? I should do like her and give you a box of cute little chocolates too~ I bet Hatsushimo would be caught off guard by that~ Hehehe~,391
Ariake,Ah So this is what it feels like to be retrofitted. I'll work harder for your sake and for everyone in the 27th Destroyer Division~,392
Ariake,You seem pretty busy today too. But don't worry I'll help you out~,392
Ariake,Yuugure has come a long way. She's no longer the little girl constantly tugging at my sleeves asking for help.,393
Ariake,Yuugure's all grown up now. When I stand next to her you can't even tell who's the older sister anymore! Ehehe,393
Ariake,Wish I got as big an upgrade to my ability to take care of people as I did to my firepower. It's not just Yuugure it's practically the entire 27th Destroyer Division I just can't keep up with all of them.,394
Ariake,Good work~ Here's your tea~,394
Ariake,Hope everyone enjoys the oodles of balloons I made for this party! Yeah I'm sure the little girls will love 'em!,395
Ariake,Yuugure it's not every day we get to attend a party like this so you should show off your stuff! Besides you look super cute in your dress. Right? See~?,395
Ariake,If we tied a balloon to Shiratsuyu she wouldn't get lost easily right? After all we'd be able to see it from anywhere.,396
Ariake,Who's been going around telling kids that you can fly if you tie a bunch of balloons together? Hatsushimo can you stop giving them strange ideas?,396
Ariake,You want to be my dance partner? Ah um! Sure if you're fine with that.,397
Ariake,Phew Time for a little break,397
Arizona,Even me?  Thank you very much!,398
Arizona,I've become calmer now,398
Arizona,Uh- Let's pretend that it didn't happen alright?,399
Arizona,Here's the list but Are the physical rewards really that important?,399
Arizona,It's great to be back safe and sound.,400
Arizona,I will protect everyone!,400
Arizona,This time I will protect all that I want!,401
Arizona,No more Just this once please let me have it my way,401
Arizona,This time I'll protect everyone!,402
Arizona,I can't cry! I have to cry for happy times!,402
Arizona,I wonder where I truly belong?,403
Arizona,Ahh Apologies. I was thinking about something sad again,403
Arizona,Thank you for always listening to me I've been feeling much better now,404
Arizona,I won't let that day happen again' you say? Thank you. Those are the words that resonated with my heart the most in my life I believe in you!,404
Arizona,This day was practically made for you wasn't it? You're always making all of us smile so I hope today I can *sniff* Damnit I said I wouldn't cry anymore but I can't stop the tears of happiness from coming out Sorry 'bout that,405
Arizona,Here borrow my handkerchief. Heehee Is it really that moving to see me smile? I think you and Pennsylvania are just being dramatic. I suppose Yeah. I'm going to try to smile every day until you both feel used to it.,405
Arizona,I heard these clothes are from the Dragon Empery but they're a bit Umm it's not that I dislike them but the thought of you seeing me in them is rather embarrassing B-but it's not like I'm going to start crying,406
Arizona,My desire to protect my friends has been made possible here. Hehe of course I'll continue to give it my all.,406
Arizona,Both in the past and present being able to help your friends in various ways outside of battle is something to be happy about. Hm? You feel happy just from being with me?,407
Arizona,If wearing this outfit means I can help my friends make wonderful memories I don't mind doing it.,407
Arizona,Do you think I should try to learn some dance steps from a real dancer? Would it be okay if I asked California for help?,408
Arizona,Stay calm Arizona,408
Arizona,Please keep this a secret from my sister,409
Arizona,Pennsylvania? Oh it's,409
Arizona,The mission rewards have arrived. It's always nice to have extra supplies.,410
Arizona,The girls seem to be back from their commissions. Good tidings arrive on the wind.,410
Arizona,I'll give it my best shot!,411
Arizona,Dancing might not be my strong suit but I know how to fight!,411
Arizona,Time to evacuate? Understood!,412
Arkhangelsk,To your desk! Chop-chop! Let's get through today's tasks quickly!,412
Arkhangelsk,You can lead the fleet as a whole but in the field I'll take command. By covering for each other victory will be certain. Having said that I wouldn't mind being the one to make decisions around the port every now and then~,413
Arkhangelsk,It's delightful to see you're still excelling Lady Warspite. You live up to your name as a royal knight.,413
Arkhangelsk,While I'm far from the only Northern Parliament battleship at this port I strive to be the best. Those aren't empty words – I mean it!,414
Arkhangelsk,Have you finished your work? Ready to start on the next task? That's the spirit. Once that's done we're onto the next and then the next after that!,414
Arkhangelsk,Being excessively polite is no different from simply being rude. Speak to me as you would any other.,415
Arkhangelsk,Wh-what are you doing–?!,415
Arkhangelsk,Attention: the mission has been completed! Spasíbo! I'm pleased you did them before I had to.,416
Arkhangelsk,Attention: a letter has arrived! It's for you. Do give it a read.,416
Arkhangelsk,So you've returned. Now you must reflect on your battle review your results and inspect your ships for damage But first have some tea while it's still warm.,417
Arkhangelsk,Attention: the commission team has returned! Now to pour something that warms the body – not tea but vodka.,417
Arkhangelsk,How about a complete modernization and retrofit next time hmm?,418
Arkhangelsk,The battlefield knows only one sovereign - me!,418
Arkhangelsk,Victory is mine. Heh not that I ever had any doubts about the outcome.,419
Arkhangelsk,All ships withdraw! You haven't seen the last of us!,419
Arkhangelsk,Brace for some revolutionary swordsmanship!,420
Arkhangelsk,My maintenance is lacking? Impossible!,420
Arkhangelsk,You're a disgrace to your position! Apply yourself!,421
Arkhangelsk,Hoho. This is what I wanted to see. An occasion this special calls for more ladylike behavior Or rather that I return your affection. Of course I gladly accept! I trust you with my future – take good care of it!,421
Arkhangelsk,As Warspite informed me today is a day of giving chocolate to people. That being the case why don't we go give everyone a hand? After all you need tea with your chocolate if you want it to taste the best. Heehee~,422
Arkhangelsk,With you commanding even in the field and me offering advice on the fleet's course – yes the port has a bright future ahead of it. Hehehe~,422
Arkhangelsk,How my abilities are put to use is for you to determine. I have no doubt you'll make the right call.,423
Arkhangelsk,Need advice? I can offer mine only if you'll rely on me!,423
Arkhangelsk,I'm not sure what to say about this,424
Arkhangelsk,Attention: new missions have come in. I suggest taking a gander at them.,424
Arkhangelsk,Mission complete! That's created some time for us to go on a date.,425
Arkhangelsk,Would you please tell me ahead of time when you want me to switch from soldier to lady mode? It's hard to dote on you at the drop of a hat – I'm not used to that. As an aside would you like to go on a date? Hehehe. Expect me to make the first move for as long as I'm not used to doting on you.,425
Arkhangelsk,Your choice treasure now belongs to master thief Arkhangelsk! Think you can arrest me? Then stop gawking and come get me!,426
Arkhangelsk,I'll be taking this treasure if you don't mind! Heheh! Royal Navy grace with Northern Parliament dexterity is not a combination to be trifled with.,426
Arkhangelsk,Our next objective is to Ah we have to bring this over to Kiev to finish our mission. Nice and easy.,427
Arkhangelsk,Despite my appearance the fact is that I am a soldier with knowledge of everything from avoiding security to moving stealthily. Shipgirls usually aren't proficient in those? I mean Doesn't it vary from person to person?,427
Arkhangelsk,You're coming in loud and clear! What do you need?,428
Arkhangelsk,Eek!,428
Asashio,I'd like to stay here forever But at this rate I won't be able to find Arashio.,429
Asashio,Happiness is a full belly and a good night's sleep.,429
Asashio,Don't worry I am not afraid anymore!,430
Asashio,What a weird feeling,430
Asashio,The mission rewards can I use them to buy something to eat?,431
Asashio,Shall I go through the email for you? Maybe there's a letter from Arashio,431
Asashio,Isn't it about time to welcome the others back?,432
Asashio,I think it'd be better to mount another anti-air gun.,432
Asashio,Anti-air preparations is everything in place?,433
Asashio,It seems that I accidentally did something awesome,433
Asashio,If only I had upgraded my anti-air equipment a bit more,434
Asashio,This time I won't fail again!,434
Asashio,The situation seems to not be ideal.,435
Asashio,Arashio Where are you?,435
Asashio,Every time I look out into the horizon memories of that time come flooding back to me,436
Asashio,My feelings for you have grown stronger since last year. This is more than just love chocolate What do you call chocolate that's gone to the next level? (Asashio approaches you with chocolate in hand.),436
Asashio,Did you sleep well and have enough to eat? Good good that's what I want to hear. Pat pat,437
Asashio,The mission rewards Let's bring some along for Ooshio.,437
Asashio,New mail Should I try singing it aloud like Michishio does?,438
Asashio,My name is Asashio and I just transferred here today. Pleased to meet you Even though I might not be able to get caught up with the course work Mr. Kitty and I will do our best.,438
Asashio,I wonder if I can find Arashio here at school?,439
Asashio,How nice it'd be to go to school with Arashio,439
Asashio,Mr. Kitty always likes to rub against peoples' legs.,440
Asashio,*yawn*It feels nice to take a nap during class but I probably shouldn't right?,440
Asashio,Even though we can't have a tea party during the winter it's fun to sit around and chat with everyone inside the kotatsu.,441
Asashio,Hold hands? Okay.,441
Asashio,There are still letters coming in even though it's New Year's day.,442
Asashio,Shall I give you a shoulder massage since you've been working so hard? Rub rub Does that feel good?,442
Asashio,Um Michishio chose this outfit Arashio picked out this hair accessory and Ooshio chose this anklet Do you think they look good on me?,443
Asashio,The fact that all of us used to be separated but can all come together to prepare for a show like this is a dream come true,443
Asashio,The long and fluttery sleeves are beautiful aren't they?,444
Asashio,It's hard to dance like this,444
Ashigara,Let your victories not be decided by the strength of your equipment but by your abilities. That is what Myoukou taught me.,445
Ashigara,Let those who think of the Sakura Empire also think of your name? Hmm Yes that is a goal that I indeed have been working towards.,445
Ashigara,I got this from Myoukou. I often record what she says so I can listen to her words when I have free time. Eh? Is that weird?,446
Ashigara,Ack! U-um I need to ask Myoukou about what I should do in this situation,446
Ashigara,Yes! With this I'm full of energy!,447
Ashigara,Everyone advance! The fortunes of war are with us!,447
Ashigara,N-not bad I suppose *blushes*,448
Ashigara,I I can keep fighting!,448
Ashigara,I'll cut you all down!,449
Ashigara,This is the hour of reckoning! Chaaarge!!,449
Ashigara,U-um.. I'm not very dexterous but I'd like you to have this origami crane that I made though I'm not sure you can really call it a crane. I've always wanted to do something like this,450
Ashigara,Haguro would probably object to me giving you chocolate but I just had to do it. Plus last year I didn't get a chance So do you like it? Thanks to Haguro I didn't go totally overboard,450
Ashigara,You'd like to train with me? Of course! Even dressed like this I have no intention of losing!,451
Ashigara,It's hard to put my hair up like this Thanks to Myoukou's help I was somehow able to manage,451
Ashigara,This is how you do the lap pillow thing right? I heard that it would help you recover from fatigue,452
Ashigara,My appearances shouldn't affect my combat performance In any case let's advance!,452
Ashigara,The cool pristine waves splashing across my skin What a comforting sensation.,453
Ashigara,I originally planned to bring headphones to listen to the soothing sound of Myoukou's Err I meant to say music! But it might be more calming to just listen to the waves.,453
Ashigara,Under the azure skies the seagulls and crabs also thrive the summer seaside also has life of its own.,454
Ashigara,Myoukou I brought my training equipment. Today's regimen is Oh I don't need it today?,454
Ashigara,I heard there are lots of crabs hiding on this beach. I wonder if I can snag a couple,455
Astoria,I'm not very smart so I'll pass on the complicated stuff but when it comes to life advice I'm your gal!,455
Astoria,New Orleans sure matured into a fine big sister. What a gal!,456
Astoria,What's up? What is it?,456
Astoria,Sitting for too long is no good. After you finish your work why don't we go for a change in pace?,457
Astoria,There's new mail~ Comander you're quite the popular one~,457
Astoria,I won't let you harm the people who are important to me!,458
Astoria,Hehe I'm pretty capable aren't I~,458
Astoria,Even I can get serious when it's do or die!,459
Astoria,Everyone go get 'em!,459
Astoria,I'm getting a little pissed off I know I said you can rely on me more but,460
Astoria,I'm not as nice as you take me for,460
Astoria,I get along with my sisters very well and like them a whole lot But sometimes I just can't help thinking what if we were called the Astoria-class instead,461
Astoria,Love is equal?  Ehehe you're always thinking about me that makes me very happy~ However here's what you don't understand: if you truly like someone then these kinds of things don't matter at all.,461
Astoria,Today's horoscope says Romance five stars?! Like no way~!,462
Astoria,Club activities? Ahaha I think I have a date with my sofa today,462
Astoria,Oh welcome back. Wanna go for some grub?,463
Astoria,Come on in sugar! Ahaha~ Not used to being greeted that way I bet.,463
Astoria,It's soooo hard to memorize everyone's preferences Don't get me wrong this job's still pretty fun. Just gotta keep at it!,464
Astoria,I had my doubts about this outfit. Thought it was a bit too skimpy but seeing as there's only girls in the fleet I guess it's fine?,464
Astoria,Vincennes! You're not fooling me with that innocent look when you just nuzzled my tiddies!,465
Astoria,Poker? I know the rules but I'm dumb and suck at it. Just don't make fun of me for that.,465
Astoria,Eep! Hey watch it! I nearly dropped the bottle!,466
Astoria,Here's the drink you ordered sugar!,466
Astoria,Bad customers don't deserve good service!,467
Atago,Welcome back! What should we do today?,467
Atago,You shouldn't ask about a maiden's weight so casually~ *giggles*,468
Atago,It seems like my shoulders are always sore,468
Atago,Hup! A little bug got into the room. You didn't see it? I'm confident in my good eyesight.,469
Atago,Oh my~ Are you going to give me a massage?,469
Atago,You can touch me even more if you'd like but there's no saying what might happen next *giggles*,470
Atago,Missions have been updated. Don't forget to take a look!,470
Atago,Mission complete! I wonder what rewards we will get~?,471
Atago,Ara~ new mail? I wonder who it's from.,471
Atago,The commission fleet is back! Let's go give them a warm welcome.,472
Atago,Naughty children need to be punished~,472
Atago,Oh my this is a bit troublesome,473
Atago,Oh my how should I torment you today?,473
Atago,Looks like big sis needs to get a little serious.,474
Atago,Hehe~ Now that you have my chocolate  is there anywhere special you want to go on our date? You thought I'd let you go so easily after you took your big sister's chocolates?,474
Atago,How many times have we spent Valentine's Day together like this? Hehe you belong to your big sister so we should be spending every day together not just Valentine's Just kidding. Though if that was actually possible you have no idea happy I'd be~,475
Atago,There are so many girls ready to give you chocolate that your big sister decided to go small this year. To make up for it I'll be with you aaall day tomorrow and do anything you want. I hope you understand Heehee!,475
Atago,Even though I would be more than glad to allow you to feast your eyes upon me forever you do need to get your work done~,476
Atago,Dar~ling if you continue like this I won't be able to hold back any more~ Hehe just kidding~,476
Atago,Surely you must be tired. Come take a nap in big sister's lap~,477
Atago,I've calmed down compared to before? Well that's because I know that you'd never leave my side hehe~ Well then come into my loving embrace~,477
Atago,Phew it sure is hot during the summer. Eh? Why is your face all red? Are you having heat stroke?,478
Atago,Kendo sword and sunglasses Takao did you really come here for vacation?,478
Atago,Running commissions in this kind of heat is no easy feat. Let’s go properly reward our hardworking girls.,479
Atago,Just the two of us enjoying the solace of winter together doesn't it set just the right mood?,479
Atago,It'd be nice if going to school could teach Takao to soften up her uptight personality,480
Atago,Hehe misbehaving students will have to be punished~,480
Atago,So you want big sister to be your fleet queen? You got it. But you'd better give it your all out there or else I'll be upset with you!,481
Atago,I'm pretty sure it was on purpose but these clothes are very revealing Hehehe. Big sister thinks it's cute when you're honest like this.,481
Atago,Me being the fleet's showgirl isn't this much to be expected~?,482
Atlanta,Mgh don't touch me like that My big sister image would be ruined!,482
Atlanta,*Eek* W-what are you doing?!,483
Atlanta,Our mission rewards have arrived. I'll give my share of the rewards to my little sisters.,483
Atlanta,You've got new mail! I wonder if any of the messages are from my sisters,484
Atlanta,Let me handle things from now on!,484
Atlanta,I'll show you what the tons-of-guns doctrine is really worth!,485
Atlanta,All targets eliminated. Requesting new mission!,485
Atlanta,Argh this is bad My big sister image is ruined,486
Atlanta,It's on now!,486
Atlanta,Sometimes I'm happy that I'm not actually your big sister,487
Atlanta,Being a big sister isn't just about looking like one you need to have the personality of one as well. That's why you can depend on me all you want~!,487
Atlanta,The bigger the better don't you think? Hey! What are you staring at?! Gee sorry for not being big enough I guess!,488
Atlanta,Are you fond of assertive big sister type characters? That is to say someone like me,488
Atlanta, Huh? You want me to take the initiative? O-o-o-o-of course I don't mind! I-I mean I'm your big sister after all so it's my job to guide you!,489
Atlanta,Thank you From now on I'll What? You'd prefer it if I took the initiative and gave it to you instead? Y-you have a point Okay then should we do it again from the start?,489
Atlanta,My chocolate is a little different this year. Can you figure out what it is? If you get it right I will grant you one wish! Come on time is ticking! Fiiive fooour threee twooo ooone,490
August_von_Parseval,Quiet you Your arrival has merely made my aide a little wary. Pay it no mind.,490
August_von_Parseval,Yes resist me. I look forward to seeing your reaction when you realize that all your struggling has been for naught.,491
August_von_Parseval,What does being my familiar entail? You shall learn in due time.,491
August_von_Parseval,You're awfully quiet Have you given up already? Obedience does not amuse me.,492
August_von_Parseval,What do you seek to learn from the Unhulde?,492
August_von_Parseval,You let your urges take control of you Fine. Revel in the bliss of your inevitable pathetic defeat.,493
August_von_Parseval,I can't imagine you'll falter in the face of such simple trials. Or missions as you call them.,493
August_von_Parseval,Mission complete. Congratulations. Another small step towards that alluring dangerous climax.,494
August_von_Parseval,There's a letter for you. I command you to read it at once.,494
August_von_Parseval,Your commission team underlings have returned. You know what to do now yes?,495
August_von_Parseval,Improving the base principles.,495
August_von_Parseval,Bow before me!,496
August_von_Parseval,I've achieved the victory you desired. It wasn't so hard.,496
August_von_Parseval,For every victor there must also be a loser,497
August_von_Parseval,There is no escaping me.,497
August_von_Parseval,tis too soon to start mourning for me.,498
August_von_Parseval,I have nothing to say to those who cannot fight.,498
August_von_Parseval,Zeppelin and I both know what you are. An insignificant insect trying to defy your destiny. Having said that I believe a soul like you isn't meant to blindly accept their destiny.,499
August_von_Parseval,I enshackled you precisely so you'd want to rebel and make me submit to you. Why you ask? Because I've been drawn to you all along. Now show me that fearsome potential that sleeps within you.,499
August_von_Parseval,People cannot say no to their hearts. Much like I cannot refute my love for you you cannot deny your feelings for me. That is the link that binds us together.,500
August_von_Parseval,So you seized the chance to subjugate me first. Yes you are at your brightest when you kick and scream in the cage known as love. Allow yourself to be bound to me and amuse me for all eternity Darling.,500
August_von_Parseval,Open your mouth. To be clear I am not giving you chocolate – I am feeding you it as my familiar. Perhaps you'll awaken from this dream perhaps you won't Either way this sweetness shall be proof of your submission.,501
August_von_Parseval,Welcome my familiar. Come hither close your eyes and surrender yourself to me. Heehee if you wish to struggle that's fine too – though I doubt you'll last long. The day has just begun and I will wait as long as it takes to lure you into my saccharine dream.,501
August_von_Parseval,My hair is a mess There we go. No I don't need a hand. I am here to serve you in this fleeting dream of yours. Enjoy it while it lasts. Hehehe.,502
August_von_Parseval,There you are my familiar and Master. I'm curious to see how you'll attempt to defy and make use of me today.,502
August_von_Parseval,Order me around as you please. A lowly maid deserves no pity or modesty from her defiant conqueror.,503
August_von_Parseval,You will never subjugate me if you get complacent in your temporary position. You desire permanence but we shall inevitably return to the status quo.,503
August_von_Parseval,I know your disposition Master. Simply watching from a distance does not satisfy you.,504
August_von_Parseval,You wish that I step on you? What a bizarre command,504
August_von_Parseval,Yes Master?,505
August_von_Parseval,Yes use your maid to satisfy all your desires Master.,505
August_von_Parseval,Mgh Yes do whatever you please,506
August_von_Parseval,Check your mail,506
August_von_Parseval,Welcome back Master. You may give me any order you desire Anything you want,507
August_von_Parseval,This new power is no dream.,507
August_von_Parseval,Keep on struggling through this ceaseless dream.,508
August_von_Parseval,This is the victory you wished for Master. Hehehe.,508
August_von_Parseval,I suppose my unfamiliarity with this role is to blame.,509
Aurora,My name symbolises the break of dawn. Ehehe~ Do you feel more energetic from seeing me?,509
Aurora,Dragon Empery? Oh it's a great place. Mm for example,510
Aurora,Even though I don't mind if you stare at me please do your work properly~,510
Aurora,Some mission rewards had not yet been collected so I retrieved them in your stead.,511
Aurora,There's new mail shall I read it aloud for you?,511
Aurora,Good work. Please take some time to relax.,512
Aurora,May we be blessed with victory~,512
Aurora,It seems I have not yet become accustomed to the battlefield,513
Aurora,Light of dawn illuminate our path!,513
Aurora,A rose by any name would smell as sweet. Whether I am called Aurora the Goddess of Dawn or even Chongqing I am still the same me. Yes I will always be at your side.,514
Aurora,I've adorned your office with more than just roses Azaleas peonies cyclamen carnations Is it not better to foster a warm and harmonious atmosphere?,514
Aurora,Elegance grace and strength of spirit I must work harder in order to become your supporting pillar.,515
Aurora,A lively festival can be quite enjoyable but there's also value in relaxing in a spacious room.,515
Aurora,Do you know what the embroidery here means? Hehe~,516
Aurora,Well done. Which would you like rose saffron or mint tea?,516
Aurora,The way you're staring at me are you waiting for me to remind you to welcome the others back? Hehe~,517
Aurora,My outfit is a bit surprising? Ehehe from now on you'll learn more and more about a different side of me~,517
Aurora,If you're tired why don't you enjoy a mandarin while listening to me read a story?,518
Aurora,Eh? What's the matter? Ah I was just thinking it'd be great if things could stay like this next year and the year after that and forever more,518
Aurora,The pigeons always seem to gather to the sound of music. Hehe turns out that they're hungry.,519
Aurora,Are you tired of working? Well is there anything you'd like to listen to?,519
Aurora,What kind of performance should I prepare for today? I have too many things to choose from,520
Aurora,The operas are just a glimpse of the Dragon Empery's five thousand rich years of culture and history As a ship with a deep connection with the Dragon Empery I hope to share the charm of these ancient traditions with many more people!,520
Aurora,One of the specialities of Sichuan opera is something called mask changing. It lets you quickly portray different emotions or even different characters. Hehe it took a lot of practice to be able to do this.,521
Aurora,Behind each minute on the stage is ten years of practice. The Dragon Empery's old adages are quite thought-provoking,521
Aurora,What are these weapons for? Um right now I mostly play the flower girl character but I hope to be able to play some warriors too! Hehe~,522
Avrora,For combat to be the sole purpose of my existence is a strange and novel feeling.,522
Avrora,I have a big heart? Thanks for the compliment.,523
Avrora,Bears? They’re pretty cute. I used to raise one.,523
Avrora,I’m not cold though~,524
Avrora,You should express your feelings in a more passionate manner.,524
Avrora,A new mission! I'm more excited than I should be.,525
Avrora,Here are your well-deserved rewards.,525
Avrora,This mail has traveled a long way to get here. Please read it.,526
Avrora,I feel like I could lift an entire bear! Hehe,526
Avrora,Victory lies ahead!,527
Avrora,We must remember the sacrifices that made this victory possible,527
Avrora,The Revolution shall not cease its march.,528
Avrora,Within the light of dawn are spilled blood and raging flames,528
Avrora,My hometown? It’s very beautiful. Although if you want to go there you would need to be prepared for the cold. Me? I’ll be fine even without clothes. Hehe want proof?,529
Avrora,While some camps seem to be enjoying the footsteps of spring the Northern Parliament is still very much cold~ There's no need to use refrigerators to keep chocolate cool—all you need to do is cover it before leaving it slightly outside your window and it becomes like this And with that my chocolate is complete  Please enjoy it with some vodka to help wash it down it'll help keep your body warm~,529
Avrora,Monopolizing your time without asking anybody else makes me feel a little guilty but There's something rather exciting about being able to give you chocolate without anyone else bothering us. Heehee do you like it when I act a bit more mischievous~?,530
Avrora,I am Avrora the princess bound within this tower by a cruel fate My beloved please come for me soon,530
Avrora,Roleplaying as a damsel in distress is rather new and exciting. Hehe~,531
Avrora,This building's ambience and lighting are just right. Heehee~,531
Avrora,I won't surrender myself to fate. I pray that the light of dawn will reach even this dark place.,532
Avrora,Even if my knight in shining armor was to come they probably wouldn't be able to get past the bears Just kidding~,532
Avrora,The captured princess was toyed with by her tormentors Something like that won't happen to me right?,533
Avrora,May freedom soon dawn upon this land,533
Avrora,The coming of dawn is yet deferred,534
Avrora,Muahaha Now these streets belong to me Sorry I bit my tongue Hmm getting into this role is quite difficult for me after all.,534
Avrora,Who's on the hit list today? Umm give me a moment I have to go over the script again,535
Avrora,You think I make a pretty good mafia boss? Mikasa and Gangut were laughing their heads off saying I wasn't cut out for the role,535
Avrora,I'll bring revolution to these streets with a single shot! Umm wait right now I'm supposed to be Right I'm a bad girl now.,536
Avrora,Who's that over there Kronshtadt? I-is she okay?!,536
Avrora,Those who stand in my way will face unbearable punishment! Come here Pirožkí I'm going to give you a biiiig hug~,537
Avrora,We've got a new job. How exciting~ Ah let's see what we have here this time Heh heh. That's how I should be responding right?,537
Avrora,The rewards are in. Here you've earned it. Heh heh~,538
Avrora,News from our top-secret contact? Let's hurry up and check.,538
Avrora,Muahaha Get 'em girls!,539
Avrora,Looks like we got busted,539
Ayanami,I've inspected the communication equipment. It won't cause any more problems,540
Ayanami,Uuu it ticklesa bit.,540
Ayanami,I don't really get it but I'm a bit happy,541
Ayanami,The rewards for the previous mission are here.,541
Ayanami,There's new mail,542
Ayanami,My power is overflowing,542
Ayanami,MVP? I don't really get it but thanks.,543
Ayanami,It's okay I'll recover quickly.,543
Ayanami,Bear witness to the true power of the Demo,544
Ayanami,I don't want to be alone,544
Ayanami,I don't really want to get any closer.,545
Ayanami,If there's one thing that worries me it would be when you are not at my side.,545
Ayanami,Rest assured This time no matter what happens I'll survive and return to you because I'll always want to see you again,546
Ayanami,Want to spend Valentine's Day gaming? Okay I'll bring potato chips in addition to the chocolate Yes this makes Ayanami happy.,546
Ayanami,Being with everyone makes me happy so I want to be able to stay together,547
Ayanami,If it is for everyone's sake I am willing to become the Demon.,547
Ayanami,I'm not sure I understand the meaning of these clothes but since you'd like me to wear them I don't mind,548
Ayanami,Everyone was staring at me so excitedly I'm not used to this,548
Ayanami,This feels a bit weird after all But if you like it I don't mind,549
Ayanami,Are these sweets? Thank you. I will try them.,549
Ayanami,There are fun things outside of combat and training too,550
Ayanami,If I stand on this pumpkin lantern will I be closer to reaching the skies?,550
Ayanami,I think I like this costume.,551
Ayanami,Tonight I am not a demon but a witch!,551
Ayanami,When I put on my headphones the music flows and washes away everything in the world except you,552
Ayanami,I'm somewhat looking forward to today's rewards,552
Ayanami,Training and commissions there<i>s no time to slack off</i,553
Ayanami,This song fits the battlefield well.,553
Ayanami,As long as you're smiling What does that mean?,554
Ayanami,This outfit feels light and easy to move in not bad at all Very cute? Um thank you,554
Ayanami,What is this ding-a-ling sound? It reminds me of our New Year back home,555
Ayanami,Training to be a waitress is something that Ayanami has never experienced before. It's very novel yes,555
Ayanami,Javelin is always so energetic no matter what she's doing. I'm a little jealous,556
Ayanami,Being a waitress is harder work than I imagined,556
Ayanami,Would you like a special combo meal to celebrate your safe return?,557
Ayanami,Even though we were supposed to use our codenames Kaga just went and spilled the beans. It's a bit troublesome when nobody is going to use them,557
Ayanami,Those Cloak of Invisibility things that they have in the Royal Navy are really cool they make me a bit jealous,558
Ayanami,When I need help I usually turn to Shouhou or Zed. As for Fubuki she always hears me out on a variety of stuff. I'm very thankful.,558
Ayanami,This cloak that Yuubari developed for me has a function that always conceals its wearer's face. That's probably good.,559
Ayanami,They're ears not horns,559
Ayanami,The mail's been Oh the members of the maid team responsible for protecting you have already looked it over. It's fine to open it.,560
Ayanami,This power is for the sake of protecting my friends!,560
Ayanami,I'll show you the power of Ayanami and her friends!,561
Ayanami,The concealment function that Yuubari added was not very useful,561
Ayanami,Z23 is always looking out for us Even though she has her own schedule to worry about she always helps us manage ours.,562
Ayanami,Fubuki seems to also be doing idol training. We should go see her in a little bit.,562
Ayanami,I never knew that there were so many things to do as an idol. I'm getting all fired up.,563
Ayanami,If I imagine performances to be like battles and think of the audience as enemies Err wait that's not going to work.,563
Ayanami,An idol's duty is to protect everyone's smiles!,564
Ayanami,Victory pose. Yeah.,564
Ayanami,During holidays everyone always has lots of fun. Of course Ayanami is also having lots of fun,565
Ayanami,Fubuki seems to have drawn Misfortune at the fortune-telling shrine but she doesn't really seem to mind Me? Small blessing. I'm glad.,565
Ayanami,New Year's outfits are very pretty but they're hard to move around in Ayanami still isn't used to it yet,566
Ayanami,Snowflakes are very beautiful but they melt as soon as they land in your palm.,566
Ayanami,New Year's isn't complete without ozoni. It's piping hot. Please have some if you'd like.,567
Ayanami,Ayanami isn't cold.,567
Ayanami,Please do not mess up my clothes Otherwise Ayanami would not know how to fix them,568
Ayanami,During New Year's there are many interesting-looking events. Ayanami would like to try going to some,568
Ayanami,What I'd like to do this year? I'd like to continue being with you as well as my friends That doesn't count? Um in that case I'd like to watch the petals with you during the spring? Is that better?,569
Ayanami,To get rid of my nerves maybe I should try releasing the †Force† like that one person taught me Is that a bad idea?,569
Ayanami,Ah! Ayanami is awake now,570
Ayanami,Let us go with grace and elegance.,570
Ayanami,I'll become the life of the party! I'm sure Fubuki would say something like that.,571
Ayanami,I can't let it end like this!,571
Ayanami,I've inspected the voicechat equipment. It won't cause any more problems,572
Ayanami,If Ayanami dies the fate of the villagers falls upon the ghost gamer,572
Ayanami,I have a feeling Little Bel is the best gamer among the Royal Maids,573
Ayanami,Could you turn up the AC please? If the room stays this hot Ayanami will evaporate,573
Ayanami,Is this gamer fuel for me? Thank you.,574
Ayanami,Well done on that battle. Ayanami has a battle to return to as well.,574
Ayanami,V for victory. From Ayanami.,575
Ayanami,Rigging activate!,575
Ayanami,I have equipped a full set of Dragon Empery Wuxia gear yes. It may not look as cool as the in-game version but this pleases the Ayanami. Heh.,576
Ayanami,Using qing-gong to fly into the air or firing huge sword beams I don't know about other people but Ayanami can't do stuff like that,576
Ayanami,Just changing into this outfit makes me feel like I'm much stronger at melee combat. It's just a feeling though yes,577
Ayanami,Ayanami's stats are well-rounded. Javelin put all her points into external kung-fu and Z23 put all hers into internal kung-fu. Those are crappy builds.,577
Ayanami,Akatsuki seems to be observing me with great interest I think I should explain things to her before there's some weird misunderstanding,578
Ayanami,If this was the real deal all the nearby flora would have turned into sharp blades But since this is just Ayanami's rigging that's not happening I guess.,578
Ayanami,This is a breach of etiquette I guess?,579
Ayanami,Your rewards are here yes. Don't forget to check them.,579
Ayanami,Commission complete. It's time to repair and resupply up.,580
Ayanami,Kurogane Greatsword: Hullbreaker-Style!,580
Ayanami,The lonesome and tragic Ayanami continues her journey unable to find a single worthy foe.,581
Ayanami,This doesn't seem to work in IRL battles,581
Ayanami,Welcome. Ayanami will be taking your order yes. Will this be dine-in or to-go? I would personally recommend the cola.,582
Ayanami,Ayanami messed up the order once I thought Zed would chew me out but she ended up encouraging me instead,582
Ayanami,If you're not sure what to order Laffey's favorite Teriyaki Twisters Zed's recommended french fries and cola make a great combo.,583
Ayanami,Hm Does this combo go better with ketchup or barbecue sauce Do you know Laffey?,583
Ayanami,Ayanami is still working,584
Ayanami,I see you're all done with your work Ayanami has to work hard too yes.,584
Ayanami,There's a delivery order When I come back I'd like to bring a portion for Javelin too.,585
Ayanami,A new shipment of food has arrived. Ayanami will go help out.,585
Ayanami,Ultimate Ability: Dynamic Kick! Oh I used my skill on the wrong target. Sorry can we try that again?,586
Ayanami,I've seen through this dungeon's layout yes. I've honed my senses by training with the legendary L.I. so you can count on me.,586
Ayanami,Sorry about the dungeon repair costs There goes all of Zed's equipment funds *sigh*,587
Ayanami,Look at that! It's a Meowfficer dressed up as a monster! Can you get EXP from defeating it?,587
Ayanami,This quest looks pretty tough yes. But if we all do our best I'm sure we'll be able to clear it!,588
Ayanami,The bonus rewards are in. We should set it aside for Zed's gear.,588
Ayanami,A message from Akashi? Probably should take it with a grain of salt yes.,589
Ayanami,Welcome back yes. First we must cleanse Laffey's debuffs. Oh she's just sleeping?,589
Ayanami,Oh. The commission team's back. I'm sure it'll be a Great Success.,590
Ayanami,When it comes to multi-hit combos Ayanami has the upper hand yes!,590
Ayanami,Your own body is the mightiest weapon. Javelin has yet to learn this heh.,591
Ayanami,Taste the Demon's jump-kick!,591
Azuma,Shall we begin the day's work? Do not worry I will be right here with you the whole time.,592
Azuma,I need more experience if I'm to keep up with the others So please give me something to do. Hehehe.,592
Azuma,This defense power will definitely be useful in battle!,593
Azuma,My guns are very precise? Thank you for saying so. I think it's more the result of training than any natural talent. Hehehe.,593
Azuma,Oh? You want to touch me? Or would you like me to touch you? You'll have to come out and say it.,594
Azuma,Is it a very difficult mission? I can help.,594
Azuma,I got the mail. Please look it over.,595
Azuma,Hehe that's it~,595
Azuma,I am to lead the fleet? I shall not make any promises but I will do what I can!,596
Azuma,This was the result of everyone's hard work. I was merely part of the team.,596
Azuma,It's now my turn~,597
Azuma,A little wound like this it's nothing!,597
Azuma,I'd like to get to know the other Sakura girls and the others besides. What do you think of holding a mixer? I could provide the refreshments! Hehehe.,598
Azuma,On top of chocolate is there anything else you want me to make for you? It's Valentine's day after all. I'm in the mood to spoil you more than usual. Fufufu~,598
Azuma,Though I am rather confident about my sturdiness I'll proceed cautiously so that you won't have to worry about me.,599
Azuma,Please look after me through both fair weather and harsh storms. I will always remain at your side and heed your every call~,599
Azuma,Now then if you've had your fun I do believe it's now my turn? Hehe just kidding~,600
Azuma,You must be tired from your sortie. Please sit down and allow me to massage your shoulders. Mm is this pressure to your liking?,600
Azuma,E-even if it's for a picture holding this pose all this time is not easy,601
Azuma,Do you need help with the decorations in your office? I'd like to give decorating a try.,601
Azuma,Don't do that! At least don't do it right now!,602
Aylwin,I had a dream that I would one day share the stage with Lexington. If I could sing and dance just like her which one of us would you support?,602
Aylwin,*pouts* Another training exercise? You keep saying next time I want to sortie and go on real missions with everyone else!,603
Aylwin,New missions have been posted~ Let's hurry up and set sail! Just kidding we still have plenty of time right now.,603
Aylwin,Hm? There seems to be some new mail Hrmm Ah! Now this seems like some good news!,604
Aylwin,Hmm I don't particularly feel any different. Whatever a gain is a gain~,604
Aylwin,Everyone let's give it our all!,605
Aylwin,Looks like it's time for Aylwin to get serious!,605
Aylwin,I'm I'm still okay probably,606
Aylwin,Would you like some sweet chocolate and nutritious cookies? Great! I made these just for you in anticipation for Valentine's. Let's get you a plate and Oh! H-hello Lexington!,606
Aylwin,Even though I spent a lot of time training with the submarines it's a totally different experience to enjoy the sight underwater.,607
Aylwin,Want to go see Lexington's performance together next time? I'll even get your ticket for you if you'd like.,607
Aylwin,What I saw just now could prove useful for anti-submarine operations,608
Aylwin,A most graceful and elegant victory. Ehehe thank you for your praise~,608
Béarn,An improvement in operational code and tactical variables This sequence should be useful. I shall write this down in my notebook.,609
Béarn,A mission has been completed. That's one burden off our minds.,609
Béarn,You would like something sugary in preparation for your mental labor? It so happens I have a list of our stock of confectionaries. Please have a look.,610
Béarn,Transport commissions and cargo escorts are vital of course but let's not forget the important safety of our docks.,610
Béarn,Now as outlined in our briefing prepare for combat!,611
Béarn,How would you say I did? Was my performance satisfactory?,611
Béarn,Let's proceed as planned.,612
Béarn,I have sustained damage but it is under control,612
Béarn,Are you curious about this book? It is just a notepad more or less. Rest assured there is nothing remarkable about it. And it is certainly not something you need look at.,613
Béarn,A grimoire? Hmm And you say L'Opiniâtre told you this? It's certainly an amusing allegory. Now I'm afraid I must take my leave for a while as I have business to attend to.,613
Béarn,If there are sacraments that can emotionally move and unite people then this so-called marriage must be the most powerful of its kind. Ah this bliss this feeling of butterflies in my stomach Now I understand how it feels to take an oath. It's quite enjoyable actually. Hehehe~,614
Béarn,Do I know a spell or sacrament that lets you eat as much chocolate as you wish? That is a difficult question. I shall look into it but before I can begin you must first eat this confectionary please. Correct it is my handmade chocolate. I already had plans to give you it.,614
Béarn,Would you like to know a spell to make even the bitterest of chocolates taste sweet? Okay first eat this chocolate until I say stop. Once that's done I'll show you every last bit of sweetness I can offer.,615
Béarn,One can seek cover from the sun but cannot escape the heat. As I'm on lifeguard duty perhaps I should've brought an electric fan with me.,615
Béarn,Both Vichya and Iris girls enjoying the summer on the same beach A lovely sight in my opinion.,616
Béarn,Your praise honors me but I can easily imagine that you praise everyone here for their swimsuits.,616
Béarn,You were out at sea? Here have a towel.,617
Bache,Drink this energizing coffee! We can't have you run outta gas can we!,617
Bache,Hah hah hah! Is it my time to sortie?,618
Bache,This outfit is what's in vogue! Do you seriously not know fashion when you see it?,618
Bache,If the other Fletchers were as flashy as me then maybe I could actually remember their names!,619
Bache,Don't come begging for my help later if you're this easily distracted and can't finish your work!,619
Bache,You might be weaksauce but you're really good at patting heads!,620
Bache,If you can't finish your missions then magnanimous me's gonna have to step up to the plate!,620
Bache,I really have to babysit you don't I? Don't forget about collecting the mission rewards!,621
Bache,Heh heh! You've got mail! Since you're such a busy bee and I'm so considerate I'll read it out for ya!,621
Bache,Suh-weet! Let's try out my new powers!,622

Bache,So weeeak! What a buncha losers! Hahahaha!,623

Bache,It's showtime!,624
Bache,Not bad! But I'm badder and stronger than you! Hahaha!,624
Bache,I'm the only one on the planet who'd look after someone as sorry as you~ Poor little thing~,625
Bache,Hm? Hurt my leg? Nope! The bandaid is just for decoration~! Nothin' for you to worry your little mind about! Heheh,625
Bache,Y'know your fashion sense has really improved; you don't look so lame anymore! Keep it up and I might fall for you~ Pfft yeah right,626
Bache,Guess I'll always need to babysit you no matter how stylish you get~ But that's okay! I'll look after you till the end of time! Hehehe hope you're ready for me!,626
Bache,Yeah? You want my chocolate once again huh? Thought as much~! Man just imagine how utterly hopeless you'd be without someone looking after you! Hehehe~ Here now gimme a Thank you Bache!,627
Bache,You want my chocolate do you huh~? I dunno though do you deserve it~? Fine I guess you can have it! Hah! Never fails to make you cry tears of joy! It's a good thing you have little ol' me to look after you no matter what happens!,627
Bache,Next thing on your schedule is eating chocolate with me hmm? Heheh~ Good thing I made enough for us both! You ought to dedicate more time on your schedule to me alone~,628
Bache,When it comes to bikes I don't know squat! So I just got my Royal Navy pal to help out! I've gotta thank her later!,628
Bache,Still looking brand new? Well yeah thanks to my daily pro-level maintenance!,629
Bache,You wanna ride my bike? Of course you can't! Think what'd happen if you crash it!,629
Bache,If there's somewhere you wanna go if you ask me really nicely with a cherry on top I just might let you hop on~,630
Bache,Seizing the chance to feel me up huh~? You dirty perv~,630
Bache,Speed-star engine at full throttle! Let's roll!  Teehee~ I came up with that sweet catchphrase long ago!,631
Bache,I've gotta come up with a sweet victory pose It doesn't concern weaksauce like you but you can brainstorm with me if you want!,631
Bache,They said I'm a wild card Does that mean I'm super talented?!,632
Bache,Hey! Wait a sec! You're throwing too fast for me to return the ball!,632
Bache,Has my tennis outfit got you crazy for me~?,633
Bailey,Giiiy Kiiie Uh Bwuuuh? It's hard to speak like a bunny,633
Bailey,The most delish carrot is always going to be the next one!,634
Bailey,I've received a transmission from Planet Bunny telling me to help you with your work. No need to thank me just leave it to me!,634
Bailey,I'm going to become a superstar one day! The most popular in the universe!,635
Bailey,What a strange feeling,635
Bailey,You should definitely stock up on carrots but you shouldn't stock up on unfinished missions!,636
Bailey,My bunny level has gone up even higher! Yeah!,636
Bailey,I'm not afraid of you!,637
Bailey,Haha! Bunnies are just super strong!,637
Bailey,*Sob* Planet Bunny won't let you off so easily!,638
Bailey,Here I go! Bunny Boosted Bane Blaster!,638
Bailey,Bunnies bite when they're angry!,639
Bailey,I'll do my best even though I'm just a bunny!,639
Bailey,Benson told me that I'm from Planet Bunny Does she think I'm still a kid or something? But but I know for a fact that Santa is real!,640
Bailey,Promise? Promise what? I don't really get it. Do you wanna become a bunny too?  Great! That means we can be together forever!,640
Bailey,Planet Bunny locally produced chocolate just for you! Benson taught me how to make it!,641
Bailey,Planet Bunny's envoy swoops down from the skies! This Valentine's chocolate is supercharged with love and made in the image of cuteness itself! Here you go! Well do you like it? I'll have to tell Benson about it if so!,641
Bailey,Planet Bunny is famous for its chocolate baskets! I made each and every one of these with a hearty dose of love! Heehee~ This must be what Benson meant by From Planet Bunny with Love!,642

Bailey,Trick or treat! If you don't hand over the candy Baily and the Bunnykin will play a trick on you!,645
Bailey,Don't you have any carrot candy? Bailey craves carrot candy!,645
Bailey,Bailey's a black bunny today. Don't mistake it for a regular ol' white bunny!,646
Bailey,Candy given away can never be reclaimed~!,646
Bailey,This strange sensation Could it be EM waves from Planet Bunny?,647
Bailey,Bailey doesn't do pumpkin pie but you can have this delicious carrot cake instead!,647
Bailey,Cutie Lucky hold on tight~!,648
Bailey,Your Bunny Santa has arrived! That's right – not regular ol' Santa but Bunny Santa! The real Santa's busy so Bailey from Planet Bunny is here to help out!,648
Bailey,Santa is real! Planet Bunny has Santa so this planet has to have one too! Heehee!,649
Bailey,Cutie and Lucky did you deliver the presents like I asked? Aww thank you!,649
Bailey,Can you carry the heavy stuff for me? Thank you! Bunny Santa rates you nice this year!,650
Bailey,Brr that's chilly Uh but that isn't the only problem here!,650
Bailey,Now that you're back it's time to get back to delivering presents! Don't worry; the cold is nothing to Bunny Santa!,651
Baltimore,SHE'S Quincy?! L-looks pretty different from the one I know But I guess it's not that unusual for ships to share the same name.,651
Baltimore,Could you fetch me an Oxy-cola? Thanks Ahhh! That hits the spot!,652
Baltimore,Eek?!  Y-you did not just hear that got it?!,652
Baltimore,Missions missions. Let's start by checking the list.,653
Baltimore,There's our mission rewards. Good to have the money for retrofits and repairs.,653
Baltimore,Commission complete. I could use some exercise so could you let me have the next one?,654
Baltimore,Great! I'm getting fitter and fitter.,654
Baltimore,All ships enter formation!,655
Baltimore,You crooks should've used your powers for good.,655
Baltimore,Even the good guys face setbacks sometimes,656
Baltimore,We've got an opening Let's take 'em out!,656
Baltimore,Don't lose control! Focus!,657
Baltimore,Let's not be overly formal and get to it: what do you wanna do next? I'm open to chat about pretty much whatever so if anything's on your mind just tell me.,657
Baltimore,You want to go shopping with me? Sure consider it done. You wanna make a date out of it? I mean might as H-hold on! When you say date you mean THAT kind of date?!,658
Baltimore,I've got Valentine's chocolate for you but Listen can I have some of your time later tonight? I was thinking we could go on a date through the lantern-lit park and that's when I'd give it to you You okay with that?,658
Baltimore,Do you know how to get to my clubroom? Or should I show you the way?,659
Baltimore,Yo Cleveland! Up for another round of basketball later? You bring Independence and I'll get Pittsburgh on the team!,659
Baltimore,A drink? Sure I could use one!  Ahh that's the ticket!,660
Baltimore,Oh my uniform's completely soaked T-thanks for letting me know,660
Baltimore,Eek?!  W-what are you doing?!,661
Baltimore,Looks like you worked up a good sweat. Here a towel. Should I go get a drink for you too?,661
Baltimore,Let's do this!,662
Baltimore,Heya you here to watch the game? Heh heavy cruiser Baltimore the passerby solver of troubles here to play it cool!,662
Baltimore,All right let's do like always and breeze through these tasks.,663
Baltimore,I'm radiating unusually dark vibes? Thanks for the compliment. I guess these decal tattoos Bremerton recommended are doing their job. As in they make people a little more cautious around me than they normally would be.,663
Baltimore,Bremerton's got a real knack for psychological warfare. She often gives me good advice on how to present myself.,664
Baltimore,I'm an expert at tennis as you'd expect. If anything you'd be kinda hard-pressed to find a sport I *don't* excel at.,664
Baltimore,I know I'm eyecatching but I didn't hope you'd stare so intensely at me I mean that's not to say I *don't* want you stare at me but,665
Baltimore,Eep?! Come on I've *told* you I'm sensitive to this sort of stuff!,665
Baltimore,Come! We shall fight head-on!,666
Baltimore,You don't need to know why I look this way. Because if you did you'd vanish from this world. I'm just kidding around. Hahaha!,666
Baltimore,Damn that Bremerton What did she make me wear this time Even though I was the one to ask her for advice Um Ugh This doesn't look too weird right?,667
Baltimore,Bremerton said When you change your look your mannerisms usually change too and suggested this dress to me She must be snickering at me actually wearing it right now,667
Baltimore,I should've gone with a less cumbersome outfit shouldn't I? Maybe something like Cleveland's suit Yeah that would've worked,668
Baltimore,The mirror? It's so I can see my– Oh god!,668
Baltimore,Woah?! Ah thanks Guess it's a real uphill battle getting used to these high heels,669
Baltimore,Life is its own journey. You can't live the perfect life but what's important is living without regrets.,669
Baltimore,What type of journey do you prefer? One that follows a strictly laid-out plan or one where you go with the flow?,670
Baltimore,Why are these other puppies following me? You know what it's all good. It's always good to have more company on a journey.,670
Baltimore,I'd love to take a shot at a Sakura Empire sport. Like archery. Or maybe kendo?,671
Baltimore,Getting lost in a foreign land is no big deal as long as you've got friends.,671
Baltimore,I asked for a flexible outfit and this is what I got. I agreed to give the team a hand and I'm gonna help as much as I can. I'd feel bad if I didn't.,672
Baltimore,Waving a flag around might look easy but it's sweaty work Oh crap sorry. I shouldn't be doing that.,672
Baltimore,Fun fact: it was Bremerton who came to me for help. I know right? Even the ever-reliable Bremerton needs a hand sometimes. I was just as surprised as you.,673
Baltimore,Eep! D-don't touch me there,673
Baltimore,Mission rewards are in. This calls for a bottle of champagne.,674
Baltimore,Nice job out there! I like to think you heard me cheering for you. Hahahah! All that matters is you remember we're all waiting for you back at port.,674
Baltimore,A commission's been completed! The girls definitely deserve a li'l victory gesture.,675
Baltimore,Change to top gear! Pedal to the metal!,675
Baltimore,Hands-on action is more my style than cheerleading is!,676
Bataan,This little one is a Hellcat endlessly useful in so many battles. Hehe.,676
Bataan,Maybe there's nothing really special about me I'm not the type to stand out in a crowd but I as long as I can do things my way and be helpful to everyone that's good enough for me. Hehehe.,677
Bataan,Mission rewards. How delightful. Hehe.,677
Bataan,The ships you sent out on commission have returned. Shall we go greet them?,678
Bataan,Onward without fear! For I stand behind you with all my might!,678
Bataan,Am I the MVP? Ahahaha this victory belongs to all of us together.,679
Bataan,Hm I must carry this lesson on to the next battle,679
Bataan,Now it's your turn little planes. Be sa~fe!,680
Bataan,We mustn't retreat yet!,680
Bataan,Perfect. Our work goes exactly according to plan Yes now on to next month's plan,681
Bataan,How will I spend my day off? I suppose I'll just lounge around by myself. That's how I like to relax after all. It's not like I have any particular hobbies or anything Aha ahaha,681
Bataan,Good morning Comman– Oops yeah that's chocolate on my lips Umm I promise I was just taste-testing the yummy chocolate I made for you and not at all gorging myself on it I-it's okay even if I was?,682
Bataan,It's a little embarrassing but I do always sleep with this little one here,682
Bataan,A pajama party? I want to go I wonder if Independence would be interested,683
Bataan,These are my favorite pajamas They aren't too childish?  They suit me? Ahahaha Th-thanks,683
Beagle,Beagle tally ho!,684
Beagle,*cries* I lost,684
Belfast,Welcome back master. I've prepared the tea. Furthermore I've sorted the documents over here. Please work at your leisure.,685
Belfast,Is something the matter master?,685
Belfast,In order to become an excellent master you must start from self confidence. Please do your best to turn your will into action master.,686
Belfast,Do you want some tea? Ah if you want something else I'll prepare some coffee or whiskey.,686
Belfast,Aimlessly touching a lady is not a gentlemanly behaviour. Please behave yourself around others.,687
Belfast,It's a maid's duty to dedicate her all to her master. Would you like to see master?,687
Belfast,A new mission has been given to us master. Please confirm it.,688
Belfast,Your rewards have been delivered Master.,688
Belfast,There's a new letter. Shall I read it for you master?,689
Belfast,Welcome back master. I've readied some light snacks over here.,689
Belfast,Master the ladies who went off for commissions have been waiting for you to greet them.,690
Belfast,I won't let you down.,690
Belfast,It's a maid's duty to remove their master's obstacles.,691
Belfast,Oh my I didn't spend as much effort as cleaning up a stain in a tablecloth.,691
Belfast,Please retreat first master. I still have some matters to attend to.,692
Belfast,Dear enemies this is going to be a little bit painfu,692
Belfast,Everyone the main dish has yet to come!,693
Belfast,Correcting her master is also a maid's duty,693
Belfast,I'm terribly sorry I'm still new to this fleet so I'm somewhat unfamiliar with my duties and cannot serve you at 100% capacity Please look forward to my continued service.,694
Belfast,This is something I made using the connections I have to the fleet. Please have a taste -- Is the taste to your liking?,694
Belfast,It is important to observe your intentions sensitively. Especially intentions that you yourself are not aware of master I'm mean you say? Hehe. Recently I've come to enjoy your troubled look a little. By all means please forgive me.,695
Belfast,Are you awake? Hehe your sleeping face was so cute I couldn't bear waking you up How did it feel resting on my lap? You are free to enjoy it to your heart's content,695
Belfast,Now this is a little troubling I'm fine with simply protecting you my master as well as occassionally enjoying your troubled look But with such an important bond being formed I've become wanting to serve you even more as well as receiving more of your attention master,696
Belfast,Happy Valentine's Day Master. I poured my gratitude and affection into this chocolate. It contains my feelings humble as they may be. I ask you to be so gracious as to accept it.,696
Belfast,Master you know while we may be ships we are also people and as such we want to do things for those we cherish and respect to express our gratitude and our love. What's that? I think saying anything more would be unbecoming of a Lady of the Royal Navy don't you?,697
Belfast,Happy Valentine's Day Master. Today I offer you not only my compromising service as a Royal Maid but also my sincerest affections as a woman.,697
Belfast,Thank you kindly for taking the time to come here Master. As you can see Little Bel and I are making chocolate at the moment and– Ah you want to proceed straight to the taste-testing? As you wish. Here you are. I – or should I say we hope it'll be to your liking.,698
Belfast,Is the flavour to your liking Master? I am honoured to hear that However I must ask you to not have too much at once as my sister and other Royal Maids will give you their chocolate shortly. You needn't finish mine today – I will gladly make more of it whenever you please.,698
Belfast,Are you destined for me? Greetings Belfast from this moment onwards I will always be with you.,699
Belfast,Are you destined for me? Greetings. Belfast from this moment onwards I will always be with you.,699
Belfast,Is today the same as usual?,700
Belfast,I'm not going to give up being your maid. Besides who could understand you better than me?,700
Belfast,Master dear darlingsome hard choices to make. Or do you have other ideas?,701
Belfast,Just do according to your own plans in my heart you will always be the best.,701
Belfast,Wearing this makes it a little inconvenient to do thingsbut if you like it so much then just be a bit more patient,702
Belfast,In comparison to standing behind you I can see more when standing beside you.,702
Belfast,W-wait a momenthonestly I'm cleaning right now..,703
Belfast,Anything interesting today? Tell me while we enjoy some dessert.,703
Belfast,Am I getting used to my new role? You really asked me a tough question butthere's no sweeter question in the world.,704
Belfast,Hehe Master why are you so stunned from seeing me? I thought you perhaps wanted to see me in a qipao was I mistaken?,704
Belfast,Welcome back Master. I specially procured some different teas from the Dragon Empery. Which one would you like to try first?,705
Belfast,The outfits of the Dragon Empery do have a certain charm. Perhaps I can give them a little recommendation to the rest of the maid team. What do you think?,705
Belfast,A variety of culinary techniques and seasoning methods the food culture of the Dragon Empery is truly eye-opening.,706
Belfast,It's customary in the Dragon Empery for everyone to get together on New Year's to have a banquet? Ahh so many people to serve my maid's soul is trembling!,706
Belfast,Only a few girls from the Dragon Empery have joined our fleet. Because of that I can't afford to let them feel lonely.,707
Belfast,Despite the fact that it is a holiday I am still ready to sortie.,707
Belfast,I see Master. The biggest drawback of this qipao is its ability to rob you of your self-control.,708
Belfast,I baked this pastry for a certain Master who is so absorbed in work to the point of forgetting to eat. Please enjoy it.,708
Belfast,Master what do you think about handing some red envelopes to the hardworking girls still out on commissions?,709
Belfast,Did you know Master all I can do for you is to learn from the cultures of the other camps in order to provide you with better service. But all this pales in comparison to all that you do for us on a daily basis yet you take yourself for granted What a lovable but also hateable person.,709
Belfast,This is special cold-weather equipment inspired by Eagle Union designs. It was made for practical purposes such as special operations in frigid climates and as such was not designed with appearances in mind. Please do forgive me Master.,710
Belfast,Welcome home Master. Your coffee is ready. Please enjoy it at your leisure.,710
Belfast,It is only by maintaining a well-regulated lifestyle that one may keep a cool head and act appropriately when backed into a corner It is with this in mind that I Belfast serve my Master as a maid.,711
Belfast,Madam Enterprise's cooking has improved noticeably. This is certainly thanks to Madam Vestal's lessons but no doubt the Master is another important reason.,711
Belfast,Such a willful appearance a maid uniform is of course the appropriate dress for a maid is it not?,712
Belfast,It would be nice if I spent more time with my sister hm? I must agree with you Master. I beg your pardon for making you worry so.,712
Belfast,Do let us know if you have any needs that the Royal Maids might service.,713
Belfast,I'm afraid this battle dress may not adequately satisfy you Master. I beg your pardon.,713
Belfast,Welcome home Master. You may rest easy knowing the Royal Maids are here to protect you.,714
Belfast,This power it certainly is not just for the sake of destruction.,714
Belfast,A victory for the Master,715
Belfast,Good evening. The Royal Maids will be chaperoning this event. It is my hope to prevent any inappropriate behaviour that might interfere with the enjoyment of the attendees. Please pardon any inconveniences this may cause.,715
Belfast,Master are you pleased with the festivities?,716
Belfast,It is a maid's duty in service to her master and Her Majesty to uphold the elegance of the banquet and safeguard it from disgrace.,716
Belfast,Master the arrangements for the venue's security have already been made. Indeed Madam Ark Royal graciously offered her assistance. Be at ease.,717
Belfast,Dear Sister let me handle the patrols. You go relax with your colleagues I just want Master all to myself? Goodness as if that has anything to do with it,717
Belfast,Have a drink? Very well if you wish to drink I can certainly accompany you But I'm afraid these Sakura Empire wines are the only ones that No matter let us have that drink.,718
Belfast,Master? Please have some self-respect. We are in public.,718
Belfast,Please continue to enjoy the banquet Master.,719
Belfast,Belfast of the Royal Maids reporting in.,719
Belfast,Hehe~ Judging from your expression Master my outfit has not fallen short of your expectations. As time is precious allow me to serve you to the utmost on this date.,720
Belfast,I am accustomed to being the one who makes the arrangements but occasionally letting others make plans for me has merits of its own. Master our next location is for you to decide. Hehe~ I'm looking forward to it.,720
Belfast,Master what would you like for lunch? I prepared some Hmm? You're fine with just that? Master you can't have snacks as a meal.,721
Belfast,This snack seems to be quite popular these days. Master would you like some? Here say ahhn~ Hehe so this must be a part of the reason why it's popular.,721
Belfast,As a maid it is my duty to serve you. However so that you may leave a positive impression of yourself upon others I will entrust the duty of carrying these bags to you Master.,722
Belfast,I should pick out some outfits for the other maids as well not just for me Of course I'll be doing the same for you Master. Hehe~,722
Belfast,Holding hands?  Master there's something nostalgic about this feeling.,723
Belfast,Even on a date one ought not be too impatient. Understood Master?,723
Belfast,Master if you don't know where you'd like to go next why don't we just wander around for a while? Sometimes the most serendipitous sights are the most memorable of all.,724
Belfast,Welcome table for one? Of course right this way. Oh? What is it? Ah I'm filling in for the manager at the moment so that makes you my customer rather than my master no?,724
Belfast,Your menu. I would recommend our new offerings here. There is also a promotional campaign of which you might take advantage.,725
Belfast,Whether serving my master or managing a restaurant it is my responsibility as a Royal Maid to handle it promptly and efficiently. Now then are you satisfied with my performance?,725
Belfast,Miss Fubuki is rather excitable but she is a clever and hardworking girl. Just give her a bit of direction and she'll figure it all right out.,726
Belfast,While the customer is free to order anything she wants as a maid I feel it is my responsibility to offer healthier suggestions. Particularly to the Union girls who order litres and litres of cola,726
Belfast,Leading customers to their tables organising shifts management all of this would make a fine training program for the Royal Maids.,727
Belfast,Yes what can I get for you?,727
Belfast,While it is indeed a maid's duty to offer everything to her master Not to be presumptuous but you could consider the time and place.,728
Belfast,Here is the pizza you ordered. Do take your time and enjoy it.,728
Belfast,It took me quite some time to prepare a suitable traditional Sakura Empire outfit. Terribly sorry. Master won't you please allow this Belfast to serve you for another year?,729
Belfast,Happy New Year Master. The maids have prepared you some New Year's dishes from the Sakura Empire. Please enjoy.,729
Belfast,Master is there something I can do for you? Holiday or no I am here to serve your every wish.,730
Belfast,An elegant fan emphasizes its holder's poise. Would you like to hold one Master? Hehehe.,730
Belfast,I was concerned that traditional Sakura Empire attire might hinder my maid work but rather it's easier to move than I thought.,731
Belfast,Madam Hiei instructed me in the ways of Sakura Empire cuisine. In exchange the Royal Maids will assist her with her next banquet. Do look forward to it Master.,731
Belfast,Master if you're tired please take a rest here.,732
Belfast,Everything has its time and place Master.,732
Belfast,You want me to join you for a shrine visit? I'd be delighted. Your Belfast will gladly accompany you.,733
Bellona,My liege I've been waiting for you. Have you prepared to face your toughest enemy today – your work?,733
Bellona,My liege would you like to have a bout with me? Of course not a serious match but just something to deepen our bonds Next time since you've got other work to focus on you say? Understood. Whenever you're ready please let me know.,734
Bellona,I much prefer fighting one-on-one compared to the disorder of a melee. There's a huge difference between focusing on one enemy versus taking stock of the big picture after all.,734
Bellona,Hm? There are marks of wear on these gloves? How careless of me. I shall prepare a new set right away.,735
Bellona,My liege your expression Did something bad happen? If you need someone to give you a push I'd love to be of assistance.,735
Bellona,Well then I shall accept this duel Oh um you were just giving me some work to do?,736
Bellona,Shall I take this as a provocation?,736
Bellona,Is this how you show your gratitude toward your subordinates? Duly noted.,737
Bellona,If you think of your missions as a duel with an invisible enemy your efficiency will go up.,737
Bellona,These are the rewards for your completed missions. Please accept them as the spoils of the victor.,738
Bellona,Mail? Is it a challenge to a duel? Please prepare Huh? That's not the case?,738
Bellona,My liege good work out there Um your cuff and collar are all ragged How about changing out first?,739
Bellona,The commission team has returned. To be rewarded for one's toils is precious indeed.,739
Bellona,The stronger I get the greater my odds of victory.,740
Bellona,A one-on-one battle shall have to wait for another day.,740
Bellona,I present this victory to you with pleasure my liege. Of course it shan't be my last victory either.,741
Bellona,While we may look past our failures we must not ignore what led to them,741
Bellona,Come we'll settle this with a duel!,742
Bellona,Purge all distractions. I'll fight with a level head!,742
Bellona,Only those with pride have the privilege to wield a sword in a duel. My liege you still have much work to do to earn it.,743
Bellona,Though I was christened after a goddess of war I'm not particularly fond of it. The only value I find in wielding a sword is in the pure enjoyment of the world of duels.,743
Bellona,Once I grasp my blade the only thing in my sight is my enemy. In that moment the sole thought in my head is to devote my all to defeating them.,744
Bellona,It's unfair to judge victory or defeat based solely on swordsmanship unless those involved are experienced. What I'm saying is what is your area of expertise my liege? Of course I'm curious but I was also wanting to try something that doesn't involve a sword.,744
Bellona,If you're interested in learning more about me how about we spar for a bit to our hearts' content? There's nothing that brings closer than that. Hehe I'll show up on time but I'll leave the time and place to you. I'm sure you wouldn't play dirty with me my liege. Would you?,745
Bellona,It is the destiny of man to wither away with the passage of time. However even if my passions wither with the passing of time I find that my emotions only mellow and become more robust as if a fine vintage. You are the first person I've desired something more than swinging swords with so Please don't let me down.,745
Bellona,I made this for you my liege. It is chocolate filled with my sincerest gratitude. I'd be truly honoured if you would accept it. Straight to the point you say? Yes. Skirting around the rules to win a duel would be nothing but disgraceful. Especially so when you're my partner my liege.,746
Bellona,Welcome back. While I do not enjoy being outnumbered it would be quite boorish of me to mouth off when there is a mountain of work to take care of. Let us do our best together.,746
Bellona,You don't have to put in so much effort into maintaining your appearance to look nice but putting in some effort to straighten things out makes you look much cooler. Alright I feel great standing here by your side. Hehe.,747
Bellona,If you are planning on going far away please allow me to escort you my liege. Hm? No need to ask for permission you say?,747
Bellona,Quite a strange way of asking someone on a date if you ask me.,748
Bellona,My liege good work out there. Here you go. I brought you a change of clothes so you can continue to maintain your appearance while you work on your documents.,748
Bellona,Even this victory shan't be my last. I've already told you haven't I? Hehe.,749
Bellona,My liege No excuse me I should be calling you Master right? Bellona of the Royal Maids reporting in. My you seem quite lost for words I'll explain the situation to you later so don't worry about it.,749
Bellona,Good day to you dear Master. Please give me your orders whatever they may be. I am always ready to use my blade Ahem I am at your beck and call.,750
Bellona,I have always been curious about the kinds of work that Dido and the others always do. I had always thought that the work the maids did was not very difficult but actually it's quite comparable to fighting in a melee.,750
Bellona,When I think of the dust as my enemy in a duel it's like fighting a phantom enemy that refuses to fight you face-to-face. I can only hope that there aren't that many.,751
Bellona,Hmm These windows with bump marks are hard to remove so they should be dealt with as an emergency As for the furniture let's just replace them.,751
Bellona,Looking at a room after a deep cleaning makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. The feeling of not even seeing a speck of dust feels as good as beating a very strong enemy in a duel.,752
Bellona,Let us clean up any unnecessary trash there might be.,752
Bellona,You shouldn't underestimate the power of the Royal Maids.,753
Bellona,Were you encouraging me? Please do not fret. My studies regarding the duties of a maid have been going quite swimmingly.,753
Bellona,Welcome back dear Master. Please take a nice rest until our next battle begins. Allow me to take your soiled clothes from you.,754
Benson,Stop touching my ears! I told you already they're real! I-I'll bite you!,754
Benson,I'm so cute! The cutest in the universe!,755
Benson,If you don't talk to me enough then I'll stop being a bunny! Woof woof!,755
Benson,Whoa! I actually fell asleep! Could this be because of that fabled super hypnosis thing?!,756
Benson,A mission? No problem! Easy peasy! Bring it on whatever it may be!,756
Benson,Come on come on! Give me a reward!,757
Benson,Were you thinking about how badly you wanted to come back and meet me~? Come here I'll give a positively explosive hug!  Hm? Fine I'm sorry I'll put away the dynamite J-just hold on a minute~,757
Benson,My cuteness level has gone up even higher!,758
Benson,It won't be as simple as going back to the title screen if we get a game over~,758
Benson,Hoho! Even the most cunning fox couldn't best a rabbit like me!,759
Benson,Benson is invincible!,759
Benson,Oh evil being who conspires against cuties in the name of the moon I will punish you!,760
Benson,Ahah! What's that tasty-looking snack you've got there?,760
Benson,This Valentine's I bring you Voila! A scale chocolate figurine of Benson your Queen of Cuteness! Now you can always keep your sweetheart close to you and bask in her love! Well always until whenever the chocolate goes bad,761
Benson,Fighting for love and peace this Halloween night it's none other than the pumpkin-style Planet Bunny cutie pie Benson!,761
Biloxi,Yeah? If you need any help just say the word. My schedule's pretty packed too but I can always squeeze in some time to take on your orders.,762
Biloxi,Big sis? Who me? Ahh you mean the lead ship. I respect Cleve just as a sister ship. Hahahah!,762
Biloxi,We *are* an improved model but we didn't end up as carriers like Bataan and our improvements aren't extensive enough to call us part of a subclass. The differences are more obvious through our looks and personalities though.,763
Biloxi,A friend always deserves help even if you yourself are in a tough spot. That's what no man left behind is all about. Ain't that right?,763
Biloxi,Check out my gear. Nobody's got better AA than I do. You bet your butt it'll shoot down bogeys like back in the Turkey Shoot.,764
Biloxi,Well done on that sortie. From this point on I'm gonna assume you'll always return triumphant.,764
Biloxi,Those commission team girls are back. Let's go check what rewards they've brought. They might have a surprise for us.,765
Biloxi,With great power comes great responsibility. That couldn't be more true.,765
Biloxi,Victory will come to us nice and easy!,766
Biloxi,Thanks for the backup guys.,766
Biloxi,Argh This isn't over yet you hear?!,767
Biloxi,No aircraft shall evade my sights!,767
Biloxi,Tsk This is nothing!,768
Biloxi,Look if you wanna do nothing all day do it without involving me.,768
Biloxi,I sometimes enjoy talking with people about what we do on our off days What? What's so weird about me bringing up people's hobbies? When I have time off I enjoy myself. I'm no workaholic you hear?,769
Biloxi,Guess it's just the two of us again. Heheh let's forget about work and have a fun chat. You know just relax. You wanna get some drinks and snacks? It's on me.,769
Biloxi,Zooming around from sea to sea can even get me feeling tired sometimes. But lately I've been having this thought This thought that here where you are is my home.,770
Biloxi,I used to think prestige meant dashing gallantly onto the battlefield But now I see how being by your side is just as No it's *more* prestigious than that idea.,770
Biloxi,Make sure you don't lose these got it? My Valentine's day chocolates aren't anything fancy but I worked long and hard to make sure they'd be delish. Make sure you enjoy them you hear?,771
Biloxi,I heard that everyone dresses up for the festival but no matter how different everyone may look they're still the same on the inside. Regardless of how my chocolate may be my feelings for you are unwavering. Ahaha how was it? Did I make your heart skip a beat?,771
Biloxi,You know how everyone always puts their unique spin on their Valentine's Day arrangements? I used to think all that stemmed from the very same feelings But is that really true? Maybe those feelings for you grow just as my chocolate-making skill has.,772
Biloxi,We're celebrating an overseas holiday hence my not-so-casual outfit today. Heheh what do you think? Looking slick?,772
Biloxi,A friend told me this look would totally steal your heart. So has it? Are you head over heels for me? Hahahah! I'm just kidding with you.,773
Biloxi,These Dragon Empery signs are really unique in a good way. I think they're fascinating.,773
Biloxi,The seat on this Manjuu cart is pretty small. I'd offer to share if there was more room.,774
Biloxi,Getting tired? Then let's catch a breather. Oh yeah could you pour me some wine? Let's have a toast. To a wonderful day!,774
Biloxi,I came up with something that could make our trip more interesting. How about we give the Manjuu a break and *you* pull the cart to our next destination? Hahahah! I'm just joking around.,775
Biloxi,My feelings for you haven't changed but yeah these clothes make me act really intimidating Maybe I'm getting into my role too much.,775
Biloxi,Let's take a ride to the party. Don't worry about the Manjuu I've seen how well he can drive What that wasn't your concern?,776
Biloxi,You oughta take today off at the very least. No need to be a busy bee and work day in day out.,776
Biloxi,Mental clarity is the key to keeping your cool on the battlefield. My sisters they all have the fortitude it takes.,777
Biloxi,Looks like someone here doesn't know proper manners.,777
Biloxi,Clear out the rest of these fools will you? Hahah guess there'll be no need for that.,778
Biloxi,Argh! Interesting!,778
Biloxi,I heard that this place is famous for its festivals with beautiful fireworks so I made sure to come dressed for the occasion What do you think? I'm even more beautiful? Well I couldn't let the fireworks be the only things leaving an impression upon you tonight! Ahaha just kidding~,779
Biloxi,I heard that this place is famous for its festivals with beautiful fireworks so I made sure to come dressed for the occasion What do you think? I'm even more beautiful? Well I couldn't let the fireworks be the only things leaving an impression upo,779
Biloxi,Even in the cold winter the thrill of watching fireworks with your friends warms you up. Ahahahah!,780
Biloxi,Being here with my sisters us all watching the fireworks together It's actually pretty nice.,780
Biloxi,Fancy my dress? You can have a closer look at it all you want later.,781
Biloxi,You wanna make like a firework and go bang or what?,781
Biloxi,The cast is all here. So what do we rehearse first? The part where we elope and live happily ever after? Hahahah!,782
Biloxi,You can't tell whether I'm playing the male or the female lead? Well I've not decided on that yet so I've read both their scripts. And don't worry I can dress the part if I go for the male role. Hahahah!,782
Biloxi,Why are you holding my hand? Are you asking me for a dance? Sure let's do it.,783
Biloxi,There's a letter for you. Be sure to read it. Who knows it could be from someone dear to you.,783
Birmingham,Someday I hope to see the sea return to its peaceful former state,784
Birmingham,I feel at ease when I'm with Cleve and my sisters. I believe this is what's known as a bond.,784
Birmingham,Is this amusing to you?,785
Birmingham,Mission rewards have arrived. Perhaps there is ice cream in Oh um never mind that.,785
Birmingham,Mail for you. My intuition tells me it's good news. If it's bad news I will help you digest it.,786
Birmingham,It is good to see you unscathed. I suggest taking a break.,786
Birmingham,Every little bit counts in the end. The worth of this commission will become clear one day.,787
Birmingham,This enhancement was necessary for me to keep advancing.,787
Birmingham,Time is money so let's strike quickly! I will lead the way!,788
Birmingham,The next battleground awaits. I will stay on my guard.,788
Birmingham,What could I have done differently,789
Birmingham,Full speed ahead!,789
Birmingham,They have superior firepower! This may be bad!,790
Birmingham,Being a light cruiser I can't markedly affect the war However I firmly believe that the power to protect the sea rests within me.,790
Birmingham,You think I'm overly stoic? True but I must be in order to repel the darkness that envelops the sea.,791
Birmingham,A smile? Like this? That is an unusual order to issue. That is not to say I dislike it *Giggle*,791
Birmingham,I strive to do all I can by myself but that didn't turn out so well this time I made this Valentine's chocolate for you and my sisters as thanks for all you do. It's probably not the best you've ever had but I hope you'll taste the feelings put into it.,792
Birmingham,Is it time to sortie? Please wait. I must park my ride somewhere first.,792
Birmingham,A bicycle must be maintained regularly so I asked U-47 for advice and help. One day I need to offer her a favor in return.,793
Birmingham,It seems the academy has no bicycling club Perhaps I should petition to create one Hmm,793
Birmingham,U-47 how about we go on a bicycling trip the next time you're off duty?,794
Birmingham,When snow falls over the farmlands it kills off crop-eating insects and keeps the soil at a stable temperature. Then when the snow melts it waters the earth Now I can see why they call it fruitful snow.,794
Birmingham,Princeton I'm pretty sure that aerial maneuver you learned from Saratoga is only good for pranking people,795
Birmingham,Ice cream doesn't melt so easily when the temperature drops. Is it weird to talk about ice cream in the middle of winter? Oh. Now I know,795
Birmingham,The family all gathering to make dumplings while they chit-chat I like the sound of this Dragon Empery tradition. It warms the heart.,796
Birmingham,You want to hold hands? My hands are a bit chilly but if you don't mind that then sure.,796
Birmingham,Apparently tying your hair up into buns like this is the norm in the Dragon Empery Huh? It's not?,797
Birmingham,Since you love learning let's get right into it. We'll start on the beach. Don't worry I wouldn't just throw you into the ocean from the start.,797
Birmingham,The windsurfing speed record is apparently over a hundred kilometers an hour. It's wild that you can go that fast from just riding the wind Hmm I don't think Cleve has ever experienced that before.,798
Birmingham,Wish Biloxi and her gals would give this a shot Actually no they've got their own hobbies. The reason I chose this one is because I'm true to myself!,798
Birmingham,Watersports at the academy don't seem particularly big but that's probably because we see enough water as shipgirls. Or I just don't know about it,799
Birmingham,That's it keep the sail leaned. You're getting the hang of this.,799
Birmingham,Do you really expect you'll maintain your balance while doing this?,800
Birmingham,Mission rewards have arrived? Sweet. Nothing beats ice cream on a hot summer day.,800
Birmingham,A letter? We'll check it later. Let's hope it's good news.,801
Birmingham,I saw you coming into the port. Great job out there now get some rest. Your surfing lesson can wait.,801
Birmingham,Must've been because I lost my balance huh Looks like I still have a lot to learn.,802
Bismarck,I look forward to working with you.,802
Bismarck,Is there something on my face?,803
Bismarck,Is there a problem? Perhaps my combat experience could prove useful?,803
Bismarck,Operation Rheinübung? I don't have fond memories of it,804
Bismarck,Keep your hands to yourself.,804
Bismarck,I am not good at expressing myself. Please do not tease me on purpose,805
Bismarck,Those who cannot finish their missions have no right to stand on the battleground.,805
Bismarck,I'm leaving the mission rewards over here,806
Bismarck,Be diligent about checking your mail.,806
Bismarck,You've done well. You've earned your rest.,807
Bismarck, The commission team has returned. I'll go greet them first.,807
Bismarck,Danke.,808
Bismarck,Follow me not Eugen. Come – we shall face our opponents no matter how numerous they may be!,808
Bismarck,Such honors may please a weakling but I am strong.,809
Bismarck,For tarnishing my pride next time you will pay with your lives.,809
Bismarck,Truth can only be found within our range!,810
Bismarck,Everyone get behind me.,810
Bismarck,Stay out of my sight.,811
Bismarck,I am not so easily impressed.,811
Bismarck,Why are you staring at me? Do I have something on my face? I'm pretty you say? Um thank you,812
Bismarck,I know that I'm not the best with words but.. I want you to know that I enjoy being at your side,812
Bismarck,As the leader of the Iron Blood no. This is a present from me personally. Compared to engineering techniques or political negotiations I can't say this is any specialty of mine. Still I'd be happy even if you just accepted my feelings.,813
Bismarck,Happy Valentine's. This chocolate is to thank you and to wish you well my trusted comrade. Ah so it's true True that it brings relief to have someone you can count on.,813
Bismarck,Looking back now the port has felt so alive recently. Perhaps that's because you're doing a good job managing all the different factions' expectations. I poured my heartfelt gratitude into these chocolates. I hope you enjoy them.,814
Bismarck,A small knight told me you'd be coming. Heehee she's become so attached to you. As for your chocolate I have it here. And don't you worry – I will always welcome you inside my workshop should you decide to stop by.,814
Bismarck,I can keep a lot of people satisfied merely by sitting here with a smile but only because of my status as the fleet leader of the Iron Blood.,815
Bismarck,A dance? Oh no I wouldn't turn one down I just haven't been asked until now,815
Bismarck,A decoration for the banquet? Splendid work.,816
Bismarck,Let us raise our glasses to the heroes who have returned from battle.,816
Bismarck,Once the commission fleet has finished dropping off their supplies let's invite them to the banquet as well.,817
Bismarck,Welcome what would you like to order? If you want we can drop this charade. I'm not used to being a waiter anyway so I prefer it this way. Hehe.,817
Bismarck,Oops I almost wrote down the usual for your order Ahem what would you like?,818
Bismarck,I feel far more at ease here than when I'm busy with research or the Iron Blood. I really hope that you feel the same way that I do.,818
Bismarck,Truthfully speaking this outfit feels more like that of a waitress than that of a maid Though I've been told there's not really much of a difference,819
Bismarck,Tirpitz compile today's sales data and send it to Friedrich. Figuring out what to do with the data we've collected is her specialty.,819
Bismarck,Eugen did tell me she wanted me to try this physical contact thing with you.,820
Bismarck,*sigh*,820
Bismarck,A new mission I wonder who would be the best fit for it.,821
Bismarck,The remunerations for the missions we've completed are here. I'm sure Graf and the others will be ecstatic to hear.,821
Bismarck,Here's your mail. I hope it's not an order of coffee from Mainz,822
Bismarck,This cup is a prize for the hero who has graciously returned from the battlefield.,822
Bismarck,Looks like the fleet has returned from their commissions Thiele I'll leave them to you.,823
Bismarck,I can take on any number of them!,823
Bismarck,Data collection is complete. Take solace in the fact that you'll be useful after your demise.,824
Bismarck,I never thought I'd be standing in front of you in this outfit like this. Still whether it was fated or not I'm glad that you were able to see a different side of me Hm. This cup's on me. Please enjoy yourself hehe.,824
Blücher,Heheh Doesn't seeing me make you all happy?,825
Blücher,Being able to meet you is like a dream come true! Mmhmm I've never been happier!,825
Blücher,It's me the girl who's more in love with you today than she was yesterday~,826
Blücher,Heheh No comparing me to anyone else~,826
Blücher,Heheh Another unforgettable memory made with you!,827
Blücher,Heheh You've got new messages including a love letter from me! Don't forget to read it!,827
Blücher,The commission team is back~ Wonder if they found any goodies out there?,828
Blücher,Heheh Have you fallen even deeper in love with me?,828
Blücher,As long as you keep your eyes on me I'm toooootally invincible!,829
Blücher,Heheh Crushiiing victory!,829
Blücher,Anything's possible when you have love!,830
Blücher,Something's wrong with you but I still love you!,830
Blücher,I need hugs from you to get the energy to do anything Heehee~ Hold me closer~ Clooooooooser!,831
Blücher,Heheh Now begins another day of lovey-dovey cuddling and flirting together,831
Blücher,It's me the girl who's so in love with you it's literally impossible to love you any more than this~,832
Blücher,Heheh Hey Eugen~ Look who's the MVP~,832
Blücher,Everyone keeps telling me to watch where I'm going! First it was Hipper now even Köln's saying it!,833
Blücher,You'll stand in for Eugen and watch over me today won't you? Or should I watch over you instead sweetheart? Heheh,833
Blücher,Which do I look more like – a bunny or a mountain hare?,834
Blücher,Hehehe–eeehh? Oh shooooot! I'm gonna fall!,834
Blücher,Gotta take it carefully here!,835
Blücher,Even I can't have it my way all the time. Hmph,835
Black_Prince,I am the Longbow of Crécy and the Shield of the Realm By your will I am at your disposal.,836
Black_Prince,A Maid? Me? Certainly not But I do know how to make some simple dishes and I suppose I could bring you some tea.,836
Black_Prince,Phew,837
Black_Prince,I sorted through the mission rewards but I'm not sure I did it right,837
Black_Prince,Show them neither mercy nor pity,838
Black_Prince,They're a fleet of smouldering hulks Not a single one left afloat.,838
Black_Prince,I failed No it can't be,839
Black_Prince,Wipe them out.,839
Black_Prince,Do I carry on? Or do I retreat?,840
Black_Prince,I've prepared you this Valentine's chocolate Master. Please eat it at your leisure. Oh uh I was trying to sound like one of the Royal Maids Was it an unconvincing impression?,840
Black_Prince,You've made chocolate for ME this year? So it's like a trade? Okay I'm on board with that. Let's give it a taste Wow. I never knew Valentine's chocolate tasted like pure happiness. Did my chocolate also taste like this every time you had it?,841
Black_Prince,I didn't think this swimsuit stood out so I was surprised when you still found me right away,841
Black_Prince,The sea is a tempestuous battlefield and yet the beach is a relaxing Eden. What an incredible duality.,842
Black_Prince,Beach volleyball? I've heard it's quite fun. Do you think I could give it a try?,842
Black_Prince,The sand is so soft so fine. It feels so pleasant between my toes,843
Black_Prince,It's the mail? Don't tell me our vacation is over already,843
Black_Prince,Too much sitting wears out one's legs. Stretching out like this Aahhh yes that's much better.,844
Black_Prince,Hah How should I spend this holiday? I think listening to music like this is quite nice Aahh,844
Black_Prince,It's a holiday. No need to move no need to fight Now why not make every day a holiday?,845
Black_Prince,Is this a festival custom?,845
Black_Prince,The kitchen sure seems busy. What's going on in there?,846
Black_Prince,Um sorry I got champagne all over you. I really feel bad about it Next time I'll be more careful.,846
Black_Prince,Dido and Sirius seem to be busy with something Should I go help out too?,847
Black_Prince,If every day was a party and there was no fighting to be seen that would be a pretty nice world.,847
Black_Prince,You're not supposed to shake the champagne bottle if you're trying to drink from it normally huh I see,848
Black_Prince,Want another glass? Mm coming right up~,848
Black_Prince,What do you think the punishment for forgetting about your missions should be One glass or one bottle?,849
Black_Prince,Mail? Is it a party invite? We're already at the party though,849
Black_Prince,Another victory? Mm then another bottle is in order Huh what do you mean I don't need to pop so many?,850
Black_Prince,Disappear like a fleeting bubble!,850
Black_Prince,Shall I uncork a bottle to celebrate the victory?,851
Black_Prince,The way to treat those important to you is to cherish them and share all your joys and sorrows with them right? Mm I'm glad to be sharing all my joy with you right now.,851
Black_Prince,I had Hermione prepare some hot tea beforehand. Feel free to have some if you're feeling worn out.,852
Black_Prince,Um want to talk about something? Uh I'm not exactly a great conversation starter but Huh just go with the flow?,852
Black_Prince,You'd like me to mix a drink? I'm not sure I can do that but I can serve pre-made stuff,853
Black_Prince,You're not the only one who comes to unwind. Sometimes other shipgirls stop by and if memory serves me properly there are some real heavyweights who can down an entire mug like it's nothing,853
Black_Prince,What's it like to get sloshed? Do your eyes get all spinny? It's like you're in a waking dream?,854
Black_Prince,Are you sloshed? Maybe you should get in touch with Dido and the others?,854
Bogue,The best pitchers are always training. Yep!,855
Bogue,Please keep my stats in mind!,855
Bogue,With this ball I can sink a submarine!,856
Bogue,What's this? Training to resist against attacks?,856
Bogue,A new goal? I will not back down!,857
Bogue,My balls have become even faster!,857
Bogue,Go curveball!,858
Bogue,Hmhmm~ As I thought I am the best pitcher.,858
Bogue,Is this the end of the tournament?,859
Bogue,Fly my fastball!,859
Bogue,Someday I hope to stand on the podium of the sea with your lead!,860
Bogue,Geesh you're humbling me You don't have to look so surprised over getting chocolate as thanks for everything you do for me You're curious about the box? Well remember the trophy I got from winning that baseball tournament? This is the box that trophy came in! Should I have put the chocolate in a regular box instead?,860
Bogue,Voila! This chocolate trophy is yours! It's a tasty replica of the first-place trophy your coaching helped me win in the Port Baseball All-Star Game! It's somehow even heavier than the real deal but that's fine right?,861
Bogue,My goal is the Major Le I mean submarine fighting a three strike finish!,861
Bogue,I am here today because of Yorkie and Lady Lex. I have to give them my thanks!,862
Bogue,Yes! Thanks for getting my ball!,862
Bogue,Haha I'm used to this type of interference now!,863
Boise,It's time for work.,863
Boise,I can go underwater but I'm no submarine. I can't stay submerged for long,864
Boise,Yes let's try to relax,864
Boise,Mm I'm listening.,865
Boise,What exactly is this?,865
Boise,You want to know more about my mask?,866
Boise,I'll look after the place while you're gone so don't worry.,866
Boise,Here are the results from the commission Please look over them.,867
Boise,Strengthening complete. Preliminary inspection in progress,867
Boise,Take a deep breath. The battle is starting!,868
Boise,Battle completed. Safely.,868
Boise,Minimize the damage!,869
Boise,Even if you can't see my face directly I want you to know that as long as I'm by your side I'll always be smiling from the bottom of my heart.,869
Boise,They're antennas not rabbit ears Would rabbit ears have been better?,870
Boise,I don't really mind showing you my face but umm that means,870
Boise,Breathe in breathe out That feels nice Phew,871
Boise,Umm is there anything you need from me?,871
Boise,I bet you haven't read the mail from last time yet. That's what I wrote in my log last time,872
Boise,Oh there's some paper stuck on your clothes. Let me wipe it off It should be okay now I think?,872
Boise,I I'll never get used to wearing this outfit in front of others I think,873
Boise,Deep breaths I'll never get used to wearing this outfit in front of others I think,873
Boise,Honolulu you don't like standing out either? T-then how about relaxing over here with me?,874
Boise,The music is a bit too loud for me,874
Boise,My handkerchief? Ah umm thank you,875
Boise,I I don't think you should be doing this *blush*,875
Boise,Is something wrong with my rabbit ears?,876
Boise,Um I decided to try on a costume since it's Halloween and all Do you think I got that witchy look down?,876
Boise,A long long time ago in a castle far away from here there once was a witch who could grant people's wishes Um I'll tell you the rest of the story later. It's quite a long story.,877
Boise,Witches won't stand out much compared to zombies and Frankenstein's monsters or so I thought.,877
Boise,Phoenix um I'm planning on watching the parade from here so I can't really participate in it with you,878
Boise,Y-You scared me!,878
Boise,What do you think about this witch's hat?,879
Boise,W-was that a will-o'-wisp just now?,879
Boise,These Dragon Empery clothes look good on me? It's rather revealing and breezy and makes me feel self-conscious but if you like it I suppose it's fine,880
Boise,The fragrance of herbs makes me feel great Maybe they really do have healing properties,880
Boise,Hiding one's face behind a fan is an established custom here Huff,881
Boise,I didn't expect Marblehead to be so familiar with Dragon Empery customs She really knows her stuff H-huh she's just trying to sound smart?,881
Boise,The food sure smells amazing Man I'm totally starving Oh um it's n-nothing!,882
Boise,Phew I-is the battle over now?,882
Bolzano,Anything I will perform any task if you think I'm suited for it. Ah I'm just saying IF! Please don't go out of your way for me if it's more trouble than it's worth.,883
Bolzano,Gorizia you're not like me – you can keep fighting I'm doomed to stay like this forever,883
Bolzano,I've gathered the documents for your meeting. What would you like me to do next? Please don't hesitate to give me orders.,884
Bolzano,I should start thinking about how to spend my next day off Maybe doing something where you can still call me in at a moment's notice,884
Bolzano,Yes? I will do anything you deem me suited for.,885
Bolzano,Wh-what are you doing?,885
Bolzano,We have been informed of new missions. Please stand by until all ships have received the sortie order.,886
Bolzano,Mission complete. Mhm this is good.,886
Bolzano,The commission team has arrived in port. Phew I'm glad they're okay.,887
Bolzano,I'm steadily becoming stronger. Thank you.,887
Bolzano,Allow me to prove myself in combat!,888
Bolzano,Victory is ours. Let's move – our friends are waiting for us.,888
Bolzano,We have failed. I knew I'm not cut out for this,889
Bolzano,Bolzano commencing bombardment!,889
Bolzano,I don't want to be locked up in the dock again!,890
Bolzano,Please stay away from us! You don't deserve any support from the girls with how you are acting now.,890
Bolzano,I'll take my leave now if that will be all Zara asked about me? Oh Well I'm perfectly fine. Forgive me for making her worry,891
Bolzano,You're still worried about me? I appreciate the concern Zara may be right with what she said about me inadvertently distancing myself from people,891
Bolzano,You'd like to take me somewhere on your day off? If that's your order then okay Um I'm afraid I don't have a favorite movie! I prefer things like books and theater over movies you see,892
Bolzano,I'm sorry for ruining it by forgetting about you and bursting into tears from the performance I've always been so easily moved by these kinds of stories And that's despite how overjoyed I was that you invited me to see the play,892
Bolzano,Um I'm hesitant to say this after you've been so kind to me but are you sure I'm the one for you? I just sincerely hope you're not giving me this out of pity or concern. If not then Then I'll g-gladly accept!,893
Bolzano,You'd like to have a word? Of course you can tell me anything! You believe in me so it's the least I can– Oh it's nothing especially important?,893
Bolzano,Trento pampers you far too much on a regular basis No I really don't have the right to say that considering I'm so dependent on you.,894
Bolzano,A tea party? Oh I'd love to accompany you on one! Heehee I can hardly wait.,894
Bolzano,Would you like to watch a play with me on your next day off? I-I'll try to pick one that won't make me weep like a baby!,895
Bolzano,Welcome back! Please get some rest for the time being. This port – YOUR port – is a safe haven.,895
Bolzano,I feel ready for anything right now. To battle!,896
Bolzano,I can't let this turn into a streak of defeats Ugh,896
Bolzano,Heheh heheheh Oh sorry! I couldn't help but laugh at the main actress' performance It feels like I've been laughing a lot today? That's because I'm over the moon just like that actress and I've wanted to smile.,897
Bolzano,This is improper attire for a secretary A-are you sure you don't mind?,897
Bolzano,So this is Swan Lake I believe there's one production where everyone is left inconsolable in the end. I'd probably cry if I saw that one,898
Bolzano,While my outfit bears some resemblance to Arizona's the overall styles differ considerably. Oh Zara didn't say that!,898
Bolzano,You don't know whether it's right or not to look at me? Um should I change clothes after all? Although then my rehearsals won't feel right,899
Bolzano,Am I doing something wrong?,899
Bolzano,Oh gosh,900
Bolzano,I'll try my best!,900
Bolzano,I just hope this was thanks to my cheering Wait I'm the MVP?,901
Bolzano,I believe that Tempesta girl has her sights on the port's treasure. Then again the treasure you know of isn't exactly buried or hidden is it? Heehee.,901
Bolzano,How will we bring this treasure back to the port I wonder Oh they're simply props so I don't have to worry about it?,902
Bolzano,O-only because we're alone out here okay?,902
Bolzano,Outstanding work. Would you like to rest for a while with me?,903
Bolzano,The commission team has returned. If anyone is lugging real treasure around it has to be them.,903
Brünhilde,Looks like you showed up to work on time. Though it may be your duty your strength of will is admirable.,904
Brünhilde,This music box? Ah it lost its voice many years ago but I figured it'd be a shame to throw it out so I held onto it.,904
Brünhilde,I would like you to hold on to the armaments I've used instead of throwing them out. That way when I look upon them I will be able to remember those who fought at my side.,905
Brünhilde,Let me check that list one more time. I'd like to prevent any failures from small mistakes getting overlooked.,905
Brünhilde,That object on your desk looks like quite the antique. Where did you get it? Oh it's no big deal it just happened to catch my eye,906
Brünhilde,Cut to the chase. I prefer keeping things to the point.,906
Brünhilde,I wonder when I'll be able to fix this nasty habit of yours.,907
Brünhilde,We've been issued a new mission. Let us strive to not let the other party down.,907
Brünhilde,Done with the mission already? You work pretty efficiently.,908
Brünhilde,Here's some mail for you. Oh Don't mind me. I suddenly felt like putting pen to parchment for some reason,908
Brünhilde,Have you returned safely? The battlefield is cruel indeed. Do not allow a single victory to make you forget that fact.,909
Brünhilde,The commission team has returned to port. Hurry and go see them - you made a promise and ought not to break it.,909
Brünhilde,Thank you. Call upon me for your next sortie.,910
Brünhilde,The smell of gunpowder Yes I have returned to the battlefield once more!,910
Brünhilde,I won't let anyone down regardless of who it may be.,911
Brünhilde,Valhalla will have to wait For now we retreat!,911
Brünhilde,I'll run you through!,912
Brünhilde,Hardly even a scratch.,912
Brünhilde,Further displays of weakness will only earn you more contempt from me.,913
Brünhilde,I love antiques. When I look at them I feel as if I'm being transported back to a bygone era. But for me the word past refers to something far far more distant.,913
Brünhilde,My love for antiques is akin to a yearning for something one cannot have. If I were born in that era how would my life have been differentI wonder if thinking this way is just human nature?,914
Brünhilde,Have you ever wanted to go back in time? To feel nostalgia from your youth experience something again or resolve something you regret..? Do you ever think about those things?,914
Brünhilde,So your desire for a better future outweighs your nostalgia for your past? Quite the astute answer. Then promise me this—don't stop until you reach that future you dream of. If you ever feel like giving up I'll be there to remind you of this promise you made with me.,915
Brünhilde,One day when I look at this ring engraved with the runes of time I may remember the moment we first met. Let us hone one another as we press forward as bearers of the same great responsibility,915
Brünhilde,Rather than questions such as Does Valhalla exist or Where do souls go after death? What matters to me is that I hold the hand of my beloved as long as my heart still beats.,916
Brünhilde,I want you to share your feelings with me whether they are good or bad.,916
Brünhilde,*sigh* Just do what you want,917
Brünhilde,So you've returned safely. The fact that you've returned from countless battles unscathed proves that you are no ordinary human. Hehehe.,917
Brünhilde,I admire your determination to cross over but our time has not yet come. Let us retreat.,918
Brünhilde,Oh you're back? Judging from how much you're sweating your battle must've been grueling as well In any case want to help untie this rope first?,918
Brünhilde,Not only are we supposed to run with our hands tied behind our backs but we're also supposed to jump and carry bread in our mouths while we're at it This so-called sports meet is probably more entertaining for the crowd than for us.,919
Brünhilde,Was that Isuzu and some Meowfficers that just sprinted past us? What kind of event are they participating in?,919
Brünhilde,Racing is a sport that originated a long time ago. Try as I might however I can't understand all of the weird rules that have been added to it,920
Brünhilde,I'm grateful that you brought me something to drink but I can't exactly bring it up to my mouth right now,920
Brünhilde,You're really such a Once you untie this binding I'm going to give you a piece of my mind.,921
Brünhilde,Victory at all costs!,921
Brünhilde,Heh. This point now belongs to me!,922
Brünhilde,I guess even I have my off-days,922
Bremerton,You look kinda moody Wait is that my cue to like go buy you a drink?,923
Bremerton,Do that again and you'll regret it real bad you hear?,923
Bremerton,Are these missions tough stuff? Hmm Maybe I'll take a look see if there's anything I can help with.,924
Bremerton,Mission's been completed. We haven't claimed the rewards yet though. Come on head out and get 'em!,924

Bremerton,Heheh! Lookit or not I'm a Baltimore-class so these chumps were easy-peasy!,926

Bremerton,I mighta been a bit too careless,928
Bremerton,Welcome to Bremerton's counseling corner! So whatcha got on your mind? Hang on what? You just wanna chat? So you want counseling on how to find a chat buddy basically?,928
Bremerton,Things I like besides fighting? I chat people up all the time and give counseling over social media sooo I guess I like hanging out with people? Oh hang on gotta check this Juustagram message. One sec,929
Bremerton,I know you're used to listening to everyone else's troubles but you can talk to me about whatever's on your mind. Oh if you wanna talk through text instead you can always DM me over Juustagram.,929
Bremerton,Welcome to Bremerton's counseling corner. Love's in the air – and on your mind am I right? Hang on lemme guess what you're thinking You're hoping to get my chocolate before anyone else's aren't ya? Well here ya go!,930
Bremerton,Here ya go! A drink a small packed lunch and some snacks from a bunch of peeps. Might be a bit much all in all but think of it as proof of how much people love you!,930
Bremerton,I see Baltimore's out there being a hero like always She should take a break sometime to focus more on fashion and other stuff girls do.,931
Bremerton,Hohoh! You like that huh~ You wanted to feel it for youself am I right?,931
Bremerton,*sigh* I always ask myself if you have to go into battle every time I see you leave but at the same time I wish I could be styling with you on the battlefield Guess my feelings are pretty mixed on this.,932
Bremerton,*gulp* *gulp* Phew I'm coming back to life! Coach thanks for practicing with me all this time!,932
Bremerton,Gah it's freakin' hot I just wanna hit the showers and then flop around in bed until it's time to sleep Oh gotta update my Juustagram Ehh forget it I'm not gonna bother today.,933
Bremerton,Coach if you're thirsty you can take a sip from my water bottle. Don't sweat the small stuff go for it!,933
Bremerton,Seems like Cooper is having a match with some Sakura Empire girls over on the next court. Coach wanna go take some sports drinks over to them in a bit?,934
Bremerton,Wanna have a friendly match? Er actually scrap that. There's no way I'd be able to beat you Coach.,934
Bremerton,Now that I'm all sweaty and gross I can't just ask to lean on your shoulder can I? Ahaha,935
Bremerton,I was an idiot for thinkin' you wouldn't try something when my guard is down,935
Bremerton,Got a letter for you Coach. If it's nothing important I could read it for ya.,936
Bremerton,Unlike Baltimore I guess I'm really not built for this kind of exercise,936
Bremerton,That commission team's come back! This is your chance to charm 'em Coach!,937
Bremerton,Stop right there evildoers! You've managed to evade justice all this time but the hour of judgment is finally upon you! Hmm making the perfect flashy debut is pretty tough isn't it?,937
Bremerton,Have you seen Ning and Ping's mad acrobatic skills? The stuff they can do legit blows my mind,938
Bremerton,Hi-yaaah! Oh yeah nailed it! Aw hang on Juustagram DM just came in!,938
Bremerton,My final move! Spinning Bird: Thunder Whip! Ow ow ow! Lesson learned: this move's too advanced for my lacking motor skills,939
Bremerton,Ooh that's good Your muscles get real stiff after so much action.,939
Bremerton,Heheh you really wanna taste my kung-fu fury that badly?,940
Bremerton,I know hairbuns are cliché but I wanted to change up my style y'know?,940
Bremerton,Mission donezo! Got another scene coming up so we'd better go get those rewards now.,941
Bremerton,Commission team just got back. You know what that means: we gotta give 'em a true kung-fu hero welcome!,941
Bremerton,C'mon show me what ya got!,942
Bremerton,I reckon we've done enough shopping for the moment. Let's stop and chill here for a bit then have another look around~,942
Bremerton,You're worried about my counseling service? Don't worry I put up a sign saying it's closed for the day. Hehe now that you know focus on our date~,943
Bremerton,Affection's somethin' that goes up bit by bit so don't underestimate the power of dates!,943

Bristol,I was told your desk can transform and your bookshelf has a secret mechanism I'm disappointed neither of those are true.,950
Bristol,The forecast saaays Awesome! It'll be sunny tomorrow! Can't go mystery-solving in the rain you know!,951
Bristol,My uniform looks pretty doesn't it?,951

Bristol,Crushing victory! Heheh! Now we can keep investigating in peace!,955
Bristol,Fiddlesticks! Agghh No regrets,955
Bristol,Your biggest mistake was underestimating this investigator!,956
Bristol,Hmph Our adventure went so badly all because you went and got the kelp curse put on you!,956
Bristol,If that'll be all do you mind if I go for a stroll around port? Awesome! Come along Data 857!,957
Bristol,Hehehe! Now we're mystery-solving partners! We'll go wherever there are clues to be found be they at sea in the skies or on land!,957
Bristol,I had a dream. I dreamt that the two of us went to the distant North on an investigation and ran into trouble. When we came to some weird people were ordering us to make chocolate and this is what we managed to bring back! Uhh it looks terrifying doesn't it? Sorry about that,958
Bristol,Kelp is really gross to me Never mind eating it I can't even touch the stuff!,958
Bristol,Data 857 and I are ready to go just give us the word! It's not time just yet? Fine I'll check my gear again in the meanwhile!,959
Bristol,My tie's all crooked? Thanks for telling me!,959
Bristol,S-so that's your favorite part of me huh,960
Bristol,There's kelp on my head Agghh No regrets,960
Bristol,Investigator task for today: gather anecdotes about Dragon Empery legends and folklore! But that's for after I've enjoyed the festivities.,961
Bristol,Sorry for dropping in unannounced Tai Yuan. I was just wondering could I borrow some books from you again? Cool thanks a bunch!,961
Bristol,Assuming a legend is a story embellished by people from many generations ago then what is the kernel of truth that inspired it all?,962
Bristol,Where's Data 857? Ingraham's doing maintenance on it. The little bot deserves a break too once in a while.,962
Bristol,If the legends are true then that makes this fish – the Kun – the biggest aquatic monster to ever exist!,963
Bristol,Allen picked these clothes out for me! Hehehe~ How do I look in them?,963
Bristol,Whoa! Hey! Don't startle me like that!,964
Bristol,Cooper I could use more soap liquid! Thanks! Come blow bubbles with me! Hehehe~,964
Brooklyn,You came just in time. A few files need your signature.,965
Brooklyn,This information is confidential so please keep it a closely guarded secret.,965
Brooklyn,It's important to communicate with other nations.,966
Brooklyn,Please don't stare at me in such a weird way.,966
Brooklyn,I may be a diplomat but don't even think about underestimating my power.,967
Brooklyn,Completing missions is a good way to demonstrate our capabilities. Please take a look at some of the new missions.,967
Brooklyn,Though it may be tough for everyone completing commissions like this will help raise our reputation. Let's start another one as soon as possible.,968
Brooklyn,Power is the foundation of gunboat diplomacies. Thank you.,968
Brooklyn,Fire at will! I have you covered!,969
Brooklyn,Now then let us talk about reparations.,969
Brooklyn,Now we won't have an advantage during the negotiations,970
Brooklyn,Deterrence is also a part of diplomacy,970
Brooklyn,I wish to fight only for you to give you the upper hand Maybe I am no longer suited to be the entire fleet's diplomat.,971
Brooklyn,Thank you now I have more confidence in managing the fleet's affairs. Hm? I may act on your behalf for a little? What a pleasant joke.  At any rate I will not let you down.,971
Brooklyn,When it comes to diplomacy gifts play an important role to some extent but this is a gift from me to you. There's no deeper meaning behind it other than my fondness of you.,972
Brooklyn,I was considering giving you some Valentine's chocolate since that's the conventional thing to do but after carefully thinking about your situation I decided to go with something more practical. Paying too much attention to messaging sometimes blinds you to the actual needs of others isn't that right?,972
Brooklyn,I've left your Valentine's gift on your desk. You'll have to find out for yourself what it is. After all the buildup to opening a gift is part of the fun. It's quite romantic wouldn't you say? Hehehe. When special occasions like this come around I feel like being a little more cheeky than usual.,973
Brooklyn,This year I thought I'd get you something that will increase your office productivity. You like these don't you? Use it while sipping tea and I'm sure Oh you found it? Yep it's hot cocoa. That's my real gift. Heehee. Surprised?,973
Bulldog,I was thinking you'd be back soon since you think about the fleet,974
Bulldog,The best thing I can do is submarine subjugatio,974
Bulldog,If you need the secretary to even notice the progress of your missions then you are truly an idiot.,975
Bulldog,Are you so lazy that you don't even want to collect the rewards?,975
Bulldog,You are low on [communication power] but please read your mails properly,976
Bulldog,This was a given. Please don't touch my head like I'm a child.,976
Bulldog,Sometimes we win sometimes we lose. It's not such a big deal.  Tsk,977
Bulldog,Lil B Lil X I'm counting on you,977
Bulldog,Yes?,978
Bulldog,The fleet? Hmm I can't say that I like it but I don't hate it either,978
Bulldog,Thank you for being patient. As I'm sure you'd rather not be seen receiving chocolate from such a small girl I decided to bide my time until there was no one else around. While I could've simply left a note like last year giving it to you personally feels more meaningful.,979
Bunker_Hill,Right now another place out there is being engulfed by the flames of war,979
Bunker_Hill,All resistance is meaningless before the Essex-class's attack formation.,980
Bunker_Hill,Don't think I'm upset just because I have little to say. Just let me know if you need anything.,980
Bunker_Hill,By the looks of things you won't learn your lesson without some harder-hitting experience.,981
Bunker_Hill,Missions should best be completed in a timely manner.,981
Bunker_Hill,There are a ton of rewards? Of course.,982
Bunker_Hill,The mail's here Wonder if there's any new intel?,982
Bunker_Hill,You've returned? Very well. Why don't we prepare for the next sortie?,983
Bunker_Hill,Pardon but I'll go greet the girls who are coming back from their commission. Just wait here until I report back.,983
Bunker_Hill,I grow stronger yet again,984
Bunker_Hill,Why did they choose to become our enemy?!,984
Bunker_Hill,So this is the end that you all chose,985
Bunker_Hill,Their power surpasses even the Dragon's Jaws?,985
Bunker_Hill,Resistance is futile!,986
Bunker_Hill,Why now of all times?!,986
Bunker_Hill,I'd rather not talk to you right now.,987
Bunker_Hill,There is no beauty in warfare. There is only ugliness in the suffering and loss of life we inflict upon each other.,987
Bunker_Hill,Don't think I'm upset just because I have little to say. If anything I'm probably thinking about something or about how to express myself.,988
Bunker_Hill,Something strange has been going on with my thoughts recently. Whenever I start thinking about things your face pops up in my head and makes it hard for me to stay calm,988
Bunker_Hill,We were born as weapons of warfare and I thought that is all we would ever be. But having spent time with you I'm beginning to think that there's more to our lives than war.,989
Bunker_Hill,Sorry My mind has gone completely blank I'm lost for words Oh that's right! I pledge loyalty and love to you until the end of time. How does that sound?,989
Bunker_Hill,All resistance is meaningless before the Essex-class's Valentine's chocolate. It's in your best interest to accept my gift without a fight I'm sounding way too threatening? Oh dear sorry,990
Bunker_Hill,I know it's Valentine's but still Sorry seeing you always makes me nervous. Listen how about this: you stay still and I'll stack the chocolates on Never mind. I feel like I'm making an offering or something,990
Bunker_Hill,Just completed another game. Might be time to go ask the ghost for more recommendations.,991
Bunker_Hill,Calm down Intrepid! You'll break the controller!,991
Bunker_Hill,Ugh so many achievements left This game has too many damn things to do!,992
Bunker_Hill,Nothing complements a gaming session like a refreshing Oxy-cola. Georgia was right all along.,992
Bunker_Hill,You wanna play? The other controller's over there. You go first and if you can't beat the boss I'll help.,993
Bunker_Hill,Dammit I'd better wrap this up,993
Bunker_Hill,The commission team's back? I'll see to them in a minute. I need to get to a save point first.,994
Bunker_Hill,This is the end you yourselves chose,994
California,I feel different from big sister? That's not true. She might not look it but she's actually kind,995
California,Ah~ Big sis didn't say much today Wha! N-nothing at all!,995
California,Ah where did my undies go? Eheh,996
California,This is comfy. Every time big sis scolds me she comforts me with this afterwards as well.,996
California,Hahaha this is good!,997
California,It's new mail. Wanna open it up right away?,997
California,Now I can reach for further waters~,998
California,Don't panicCalm down Let's go!,998
California,Aaah that was a great workout,999
California,Oof Big sis will lecture me for sure!,999
California,We've already had fun throughout the docks. How about we go some place farther? Just the two of us Heh heh heh,1000
California,Do you want some Valentine's chocolate? Then here you go  I included my sister's chocolate too so if you can't finish it just leave it in the fridge.,1000
California,I assume the reason you're here is my sister somehow roped you into this. Getting a scenic date instead of chocolate. Unfortunately you won't get your private time because I'm coming along too. Don't feel too bad about it though 'cuz I brought chocolate for both of you.,1001
Carabiniere,Royal submarines have always been elusive and mercurial. They've gotten the better of me in the past,1001
Carabiniere,My gun? I'm telling you it's real! I just don't have it loaded.,1002
Carabiniere,Don't disturb during work hours. I put this sign up so you can have your peace of mind!,1002
Carabiniere,Sì!,1003
Carabiniere,P-please don't tease your subordinates like that!,1003
Carabiniere,The missions are done and we have quite the rewards to show for it. If there were some non-material rewards though,1004
Carabiniere,The commission team has returned! I'm so glad that everyone came back safely.,1004
Carabiniere,I shall definitely become a better subordinate!,1005
Carabiniere,Victory is ours!,1005
Carabiniere,Ugh th-this subordinate will accept any punishment!,1006
Carabiniere,Locked on!,1006
Carabiniere,This isn't how it was supposed to be,1007
Carabiniere,From now on this subordinate shall serve you for life! That's not what it means? Um then I see! B-but can someone like me really be your partner?,1007
Carabiniere,Everything went so smoothly this year that I'm not sure what to comment on Uh that's not to say I was making anything elaborate not at all! Besides I can only make basic chocolate anyway Err please pretend you didn't hear that!,1008
Carabiniere,I can't help but to feel a little different when I put on these clothes. I know it's supposed to feel light and refreshing but instead I feel defenseless and nervous,1008
Carabiniere,If you're thirsty I brought some water. Here you go!,1009
Carabiniere,The warm sunlight the gentle breeze and an ice pop to beat the heat! That's the spirit of midsummer!,1009
Carabiniere,Wouldn't it be better to finish the missions first,1010
Carabiniere,Ugh I s-suppose I'm not cut out for this after all,1010
Carabiniere,I once said I wanted to be your bodyguard but when we're walking together like this it feels like you're guarding me instead. Would this be dereliction of duty? Ah! I wasn't saying that I disapproved of it! *sigh*,1011
Casablanca,Time is of the essence. Let us quickly begin the day's work.,1011
Casablanca,Although fighting on the front lines is not my specialty I'll give it my all if needed!,1012
Casablanca,If possible I'd like to hear about what happened at the Battle of Casablanca from Massachusetts.,1012
Casablanca,Eek?! I I've never read about stuff like this in my books before!,1013
Casablanca,Mission complete! All right with these supplies your fleet operations should be even smoother.,1013
Casablanca,I've finished checking the resources from the commission. Please confirm.,1014
Casablanca,A head-on battle huh All right leave the air support to me!,1014
Casablanca,First place me? Hmph. Fighting on the front lines might be easier than I expected.,1015
Casablanca,There's only so much I can do on the front lines as an escort carrier,1015
Casablanca,I will do everything in my power to protect everyone!,1016
Casablanca,Gah This is starting to look impossible,1016
Casablanca,So you were the greatest obstacle to the development of the fleet,1017
Casablanca,First Ameer then Alazon Bay and finally Casablanca. Isn't it nice when your name bodes good fortune? Hehe~,1017
Casablanca,I like movies and books. I adore stories with high and low points and emotionally touching scenes. As for my favorite genre that would be Umm it's a secret!,1018
Casablanca,The Port's Carrier Weekly? It's featuring one of my sister ships? Th-that's a little embarrassing for me,1018
Casablanca,Cheerleaders raise the morale of the players. It doesn't seem much different from the role of an escort carrier supporting those who are working hard on the battlefield.,1019
Casablanca,Getting the choreography down isn't the hard part. It's being able to cheer so enthusiastically like Reno It's a bit too embarrassing if you ask me,1019
Casablanca,Captain Reno I think your enthusiasm is nothing but commendable but wouldn't it be better to take a break now to conserve our energy?,1020
Casablanca,Even though this squad was thrown together last minute thanks to the support of you and Craven I don't want to lose to the other factions!,1020
Casablanca,The actual meet is coming up I've got to practice even harder!,1021
Cassin,I don't have anything you'd be interested in,1021
Cassin,Don't you have anything to say? I'm not great at starting conversations,1022
Cassin,Oh you want to know about my eyes? One of them is fake Can you guess which?,1022
Cassin,Everyone is back! That's good,1023
Cassin,Mmm I don't hate this feeling,1023
Cassin,Are you interested in shut-in girls?,1024
Cassin,Hm We have some uncompleted missions is that really fine?,1024
Cassin,Rewards have arrived Looks like we did well,1025
Cassin,New mail Aren't you going to take a look?,1025
Cassin,My sister said I'd die from boredom if I always stay in my room But we all die eventually anyway so what's the big deal?,1026
Cassin,Work is finished,1026
Cassin,Even if I get stronger I'd rather stay in my room,1027
Cassin,Well you're keeping me from my time off I need to teach you some manners!,1027
Cassin,What? That was it?,1028
Cassin,What a pain Might as well head back.,1028
Cassin,I wanna go home,1029
Cassin,Can't you just let me sleep for a while?,1029
Cassin,Hmm how should I say this If you're free would you like to take a nap together?,1030
Cassin,Here chocolate from me. I hope now you know even lazy girls can make chocolate sometimes Eh just kidding.,1030
Cassin,Up we go There. Thanks for carting me around. We done shopping now? We got the chocolate ingredients and the stuff Downes asked for so I think we're good. By the way I'm kinda surprised how light these groceries are. Well I guess they would be compared to how much I weigh.,1031
Cassin,So This one's regular this one's not as sweet this one has a fruity taste and this one has a dash of liqueur in it. Yeah I thought I'd try a bunch of different kinds this year. Downes and Laffey gave me a hand so they're all bound to taste great. Pick and choose whichever you want.,1031
Cassin,Mmh just staying together quietly like this might be pretty nice too.,1032
Cassin,I know I said we'd go shopping after school but walking is so exhausting I'll just hitch a ride in this cart. Looks sturdy enough,1032
Cassin,Huh? Is there something weird about me sitting in the shopping cart?,1033
Cassin,I think Downes works here part-time. Just hope she doesn't kerplode anything,1033
Cassin,You could stock up on instant noodles so you won't have to go shopping for food for a good while. I think it's a good idea.,1034
Cassin,Yeah? What? I'm not exactly hogging the entire cart to myself am I?,1034
Cassin,There's security cams in here you know,1035
Cassin,Anything interesting happen late– Aahh! For the love of Watch it where you put those ice-cold drinks!,1035
Centaur,My appearance? Right well my name derives from a mythological creature so that's why I look rather fantastical?,1036
Centaur,Peaceful carefree days certainly are lovely and yet I can't help but wonder from time to time why was I even born?,1036
Centaur,You want to try pulling my bowstring? Hehe it's harder than it looks huh?,1037
Centaur,I can hear it. A whisper on the wind Hehe just kidding. Huh? The commission team has returned.,1037
Centaur,Elders let us strive together for victory!,1038
Centaur,Forgive me Elders,1038
Centaur,I've learnt from the Elders I'll show you their courage!,1039
Centaur,Just as the Elders do I shall hold fast!,1039
Centaur,How could my beloved fleet turn out like this,1040
Centaur,It it isn't really that shocking that I use polite language with the destroyer Elders is it? B- but to me those girls are also my Elders worthy of respect!,1040
Centaur,I understand now that the others are ordinary people just like me. But it's still not wrong to treat them with respect. Not only as their Childe but also as their sister-in-arms.,1041
Centaur,According to Albion among others I am allowed to make bolder advances on Valentine's Day. However I felt that would be disgraceful to my Elders This matter has caused me great consternation and now Valentine's Day is upon us. I may still be conflicted but nevertheless Please do accept my chocolate!,1041
Centaur,The Elders haven't been shy about complimenting my figure though I can't help but feel a little bit embarrassed,1042
Centaur,Taking in the ocean feeling the sea breeze letting the sounds of the waves lap against my ears I feel completely at peace here.,1042
Centaur,Looks like everyone from the Dragon Empery is in the midst of preparing their Spring Festival celebrations but I'm not sure there's anything I could help with,1043
Centaur,In the coming year I'll be trying even harder to learn from my Elders!,1043
Centaur,Th-the Elders are all watching,1044
Centaur,It really looks like the whole fleet is having a good time and getting along so well This season is truly delightful.,1044

Champagne,Our true destination still awaits.,1051
Champagne,Sleep in the blue depths of the ocean,1051
Champagne,These scars will become my aegis.,1052
Champagne,This world is the surface of a calm lake— Disturbances may mar the waters with ripples but peace must return in time.,1052

Champagne,The Cardinal's favorite book was one recommended by me. Humans and ships alike desire to satisfy their curiosity,1058
Champagne,Animals attempt to break their fetters in order to satiate their desires whereas humans challenge taboos to satiate their curiosity.,1058
Champagne,Hm? Did you want to know about my dreams?,1059
Champagne,Please enlighten me. The significance of this festive garb and the things I must do.,1059
Chang_Chun,I definitely am not hiding the stuff that Fu Shun secretly bought.,1060
Chang_Chun,During the summer Tai Yuan will make a breezier version for me so there's no problem.,1060
Chang_Chun,Fu Shun I heard that terrifying monsters appear in the academy after the sun goes down.,1061
Chang_Chun,Missions are also very important.,1061
Chang_Chun,Next up is Ehh? What's that burning smell coming from the warehouse? Ah my snack,1062

Chang_Chun,Now things are getting interesting~,1066
Chang_Chun,I heard that Prince Rupert's drops can be used to ward off the evil monsters that come out at night so I told Fu Shun. The windows at the academy are gone? I-I have no idea what you're talking about~,1066
Chang_Chun,You want me to take off my cosplay? Ehehe~ I suppose I can but you'll have to do what I say!,1067
Chang_Chun,If you never leave my side I can consider your request~ Just kidding! Your gullibility is a good thing though~,1067
Chang_Chun,Here's this year's Valentine's chocolate~ Fu Shun Tai Yuan and I made it together but I probably spent more time scrubbing exploded chocolate off the kitchen walls Well it still tastes pretty good so give it a try. Speaking of An Shan I wonder where she went today?,1068
Chang_Chun,Fu Shun if An Shan finds out that you're making micromissiles she's gonna be so pissed.,1068
Chang_Chun,Hmm It does feel rather breezy behind my head without my hood,1069
Chang_Chun,Missiles versus naval guns? Eh there's no point comparing things from two different eras~,1069
Chang_Chun,My gear's not the only thing different about me! I've got a new look too! Heh~,1070
Chang_Chun,Missiles huh I wonder if I'm stronger now.,1070
Chang_Chun,Ta-da! My pajamas are finally finished! Now to snuggle up until I'm all warm! Eh~ Ehhh? But sis I don't want to get out! Ack did Tai Yuan purposely make this tail big and thick to make it easier for you?,1071
Chang_Chun,Fu Shun said she's planning to blast apart an underwater volcano to turn the entire ocean into a hot spring Thankfully I don't think the water is getting any warmer~,1071
Chang_Chun,Fu Shun do you still not have enough firecrackers? How would I know if this is enough to boil the entire sea?,1072

Chao_Ho,Don't talk to me like you know me!,1081
Chao_Ho,Um Ying Swei said you don't like short-tempered girls so I'll try to act a bit mellower! So um please don't hate me Hey wh-what are you laughing for?! Don't get all uppity with me!,1081
Chao_Ho,About my new dance um I want you to name it since you'll be the first person who gets to see it. So how about it? Y-you don't have to come if you don't want to! Ugh! I mean you have to come! No matter what! Even if you don't want to! Jeez!,1082
Chao_Ho,At a time like this I'm supposed to say may we hold hands and hope to live forever with one another or something like that right Ahh I can't remember this stuff! A-anyway you have to take good care of me from now on! Got it?!,1082
Chao_Ho,Happy Valentine's Day! This chocolate is for you! Why am I waiting in front of the office you ask? If Ying Swei beat me to the punch my pride as the older sister would be tarnished!!!,1083
Chao_Ho,Ying Swei and I made a promise that we'd deliver our chocolates together today and neither is allowed to jump the gun But I wonder why she forgot to show up at the time we agreed on Well whatever! That just means I get to give you my chocolate first! Hehe~,1083
Chao_Ho,Happy Valentine's! My sister and I struck an agreement this time – we began from a starting line and whoever found you first got dibs. Looks like that's me! She got the better of me last time but that's not going to happen ever again!,1084
Chao_Ho,What took you so long?! Are you trying to make me worry on purpose you dolt,1084
Chao_Ho,Who's the big sister of the Chao Ho class? That's right! I'm Ying Swei's big sister~ I'm glad you understand now!,1085
Chao_Ho,You're leaving this assignment to me? G-got it! I'll show you what a capable big sis I am!,1085
Chao_Ho,You haven't moved a muscle for quite some time now! S-say something to me every now and then! O-otherwise I'll get worried,1086
Chao_Ho,Mm fish and chips~ Even the Royal Navy has some pretty good food~,1086
Chao_Ho,H-hey you're not comparing me to Ying Swei are you,1087
Chao_Ho,We've got new missions! Wh-what is it? Are you not gonna do anything unless I nag like your mother?,1087
Chao_Ho,That mission was a piece of cake wouldn't you agree?,1088
Chao_Ho,My performance for the Spring Festival banquet? I-i-it's not like I'm nervous or anything! I've practiced over and over!,1088
Chao_Ho,I wish my sister was as demure and well-behaved as Tai Yuan Yeah Ying Swei I'm talking about you! Stop laughing!,1089
Chao_Ho,D-don't scare me like that!,1089
Chao_Ho,Y-you're gonna get eaten up by the Nian beast!,1090
Chao_Ho,Don't worry this tree is real sturdy and won't break with just one person on it Hey wait are you calling me fat?!,1090
Chao_Ho,Ahhhhh jeez what's wrong with these pipsqueaks?! I swear they're running from me on purpose I knew it! This is all Ying Swei's fault! I knew she had an ulterior motive for assigning an easy job like decorating to me!,1091
Chao_Ho,Ying! Swei! I know you're behind all this so get these little guys to knock it off already!,1091
Chao_Ho,I wonder how the decorations for the other parts of the port are coming along Huh? You've already taken care of everything? W-wow you're pretty reliable huh,1092
Chao_Ho,I I didn't touch you on purpose okay? I'm sorry! It's all because this little bugger here made me do it,1092
Chao_Ho,Y-y-y-y-y-you pervert! I can't believe you'd take advantage of another person's misery like this!,1093
Chao_Ho,Why's there a letter addressed to you in a place like this? Did you misplace it or something?,1093
Chao_Ho,Umm you don't need to be that worried about me. I'm used to Ying Swei playing pranks on me by now and besides she already said she's sorry Well if you insist on apologizing on her behalf um then go on a date with me after this! You're fine with that? Heehee I'm gonna make Ying Swei soooo jealous for what she did to me today~,1094
Chapayev,If you're worried those you trust will betray you you just have to keep them close. Either rope or chains will do the trick right?,1094
Chapayev,You want to feel? Ah not this little guy. I mean me. Hehehe.,1095
Chapayev,All these unfinished tasks Wouldn't it be better if I helped you take care of them?,1095
Chapayev,Wow you completed that mission all by yourself! Hehe were you hoping I'd give you a reward?,1096
Chapayev,I sorted the mail for you. Don't forget to look it over.,1096
Chapayev,What do you think of my food? Is this the kind of thing you like to eat?,1097
Chapayev,Keep strengthening my equipment. I know you can do it.,1097
Chapayev,I can handle these girls just fine! Hiyah!,1098
Chapayev,Hah that seems about right.,1098
Chapayev,Hah I can do better.,1099
Chapayev,Scorched earth!,1099
Chapayev,Gah was I unprepared?,1100
Chapayev,You may need some stricter training. Hm. Worrying,1100
Chapayev,To get such a ring such a beautiful gift it's wonderful. So let me give you this bridle in return Hehe it fits perfectly. Now it's like we're always connected wherever we might be Don't you love it?,1101
Chapayev,It's a big responsibility to have someone trust you so much. But don't worry I'm holding your reins tightly.,1101
Chapayev,Just let me know when you'd like to talk to another girl. You'd be very embarrassed to be seen like this hm? Hehe I think it's fine if somebody sees actually.,1102
Chapayev,Hehe I'll join you in a minute okay?,1102
Chapayev,You did so well on that sortie Now you just let me take care of everything.,1103
Chapayev,Hehehe I'm happy if you are.,1103
Chapayev,Still feeling a little uneasy? Just wait a bit longer. You need to stay bound to me like this for now but sooner or later you won't have to think anymore you won't have to worry and you can forget all that pain.,1104
Chapayev,You know this room might rub some people the wrong way,1104
Chapayev,If I'm here too long you know Tashkent will start to worry,1105
Chapayev,I- I have to keep this around my neck?,1105
Chapayev,There's an unfinished mission. I have all the details here.,1106
Chapayev,Mission complete. What should we do now?,1106
Chapayev,Mail's here I think you should read it,1107
Chapayev,The commission girls just got back. You have to get out there and bring them in,1107
Chapayev,I have to try harder right?,1108
Chapayev,I fight with all my heart!,1108
Chapayev,I guess I can relax a little,1109
Chapayev,I get that you wanted to be alone with me and that's fine but I just think we're missing something If only we could hold each other's hands tightly or Ahhn?! D- don't pull on that!,1109
Chapayev,This book? I picked it up on Belorussiya's recommendation. It might be a bit too hard for you though. Unlikely you say? Read me a few pages then.,1110
Chapayev,Do you want me to oil you up?,1110
Chapayev,Heehee I might have used too much lotion.,1111
Chapayev,You must be tired. How about a sweet refreshment to clear away the fatigue? Here you are sweetheart. Just don't have too much now.,1111
Chapayev,I'll disrupt the enemy line!,1112
Chapayev,You've been looking for me? Heehee sorry if I made you worry I just had to feel the night breeze in my hair for a bit. Why don't you stay and enjoy it with me?,1112
Chapayev,Ooh this water is nice and cold Heehee. Perfect for cooling off in.,1113
Chapayev,I hope Soyuz will pay this place a visit someday. Lord knows she deserves a good refresher.,1113
Chapayev,This yukata feels lovely on my skin. It's like I'm dressed tip to toe in silk.,1114
Chapayev,Doesn't vacationing make you feel like the leash has come off? You don't get the analogy? Hmm well fair enough,1114
Chapayev,We can hold hands if you're scared of getting separated. Unless you'd rather be led along by a pair of reins?,1115
Chapayev,Heehee. Doesn't that feel nice?,1115
Chapayev,Hey great job on that mission. Heehee how does a hot bath sound for a reward?,1116
Chapayev,Why don't we go watch how artisans dye clothes blue?,1116
Chapayev,I suppose this is one way to de-stress.,1117
Chapayev,You've no reason to worry. The bond between us is so strong that no matter which of us pulls the reins our feelings are clear to us both. Like this – if I just pull your hand towards me you can hear the beating of my heart no?,1117
Charybdis,Good morning to you Master. Will you be starting off the day with some work?,1118
Charybdis,Master is there anything new you'd like to wear when you head out on missions? If that's what you'd like please leave it to me! It so happens sewing is one of my specialties,1118
Charybdis,Fair winds and a following sea~ Master if it's fine with you please take me along in your next mission as well.,1119
Charybdis,There's nothing for me to do right now? N-no way Master how could you do this to me,1119
Charybdis,Master~ If you'd please change into– Y-you can't see the documents you're working on? Ahh I'm sorry!,1120

Charybdis,I'm here to deliver this mail to you Master.,1122
Charybdis,Welcome back Master! Let's make sure you don't overdo things and take a short break first~,1123
Charybdis,A commission has been completed. I wonder how it went?,1123
Charybdis,Behold my true power! Heehee.,1124
Charybdis,Anti-air combat commence! Master please lower your head!,1124

Charybdis,Stay calm it's time for our counterattack!,1126
Charybdis,Wh-where's the enemy?,1126
Charybdis,I Master do you throw everyone to the wolves like this?,1127
Charybdis,Hm-hmm~ Whenever wherever I'll be there to serve you as your maid. A-and please don't remind me of how I mess up sometimes,1127
Charybdis,It may be an exaggeration to say whenever wherever but I simply wish to be there to serve you whenever you might need me I'm sorry,1128
Charybdis,If I do everything for you you'll become incapable of doing anything for yourself? Am I that powerful of an existence?,1128
Charybdis,I-I'll do everything for you but in moderation Wait! I'll just do my best to relieve some of your fatigue~ Roger! I'll make sure to exercise restraint!,1129
Charybdis,What's this Master? Y-you really weren't satisfied just having your fatigue relieved?! *sigh* I-I mean even without this ring Oh! Is this a symbol of your permission for me to pamper you lots and lots more~? Heehee my dear Master of course I love you lots~,1129
Charybdis,I've come to answer your summons Master! Let's get right to it. Please assume the position so I may give you relie– Pardon I mean so I may give you my Valentine's chocolate! As today is a special day I'm ready to answer your summons anytime anywhere,1130
Charybdis,Please have a seat Master. You should be comfortable while you enjoy my chocolate. I thought long and hard about how to relieve your fatigue and I settled on making you a lot and I mean A LOT of chocolate! Now please allow me to serve you until you've finished all your chocolate~,1130
Charybdis,Heehee it's adorable how devoted you are to your job Master~ Sorry I'll go and prepare the documents right away.,1131
Charybdis,Master does it feel good~? Heehee since we're fine on time I'll keep on pampering you more and more~,1131
Charybdis,May your mission today be successful and may you return safe and sound All right Master. Everything is bound to go swimmingly!,1132
Charybdis,I-is there really nothing I can do to help? I can't believe you'd just leave me with nothing to do like this There's no way this should be allowed Masterrrr,1132
Charybdis,Master let's check on this report together You can't see the report because my chest is in the way? Oh goodness I'm sorry,1133
Charybdis,Master? Whenever wherever please leave everything to me~!,1133
Charybdis,Oh Master you~ Heehee,1134
Charybdis,Master I've received word that there's a new mission for you. Though it looks like you were already aware of it I-it was Dido who informed you about it?!,1134
Charybdis,Master allow me to take your coat~ Here's a towel a warm cup of coffee and a hug from me~,1135
Charybdis,I'll say it once again. Ahem An elegant victory just the way your maid does it!,1135
Charybdis,I won't let you be swallowed up by the sea! Grab my hand!,1136
Charybdis,Thank you for waiting my dear Master. Heehee you seem pretty tired Hah! I'll pet you on the head today. Good work good work~ I'm not going anywhere so just sit tight and let my affection warm you up~!,1136
Charybdis,*Pats thighs* Master you poor thing~ Look how hard you've been working~ Hehe hurry and come here so that I can pamper you~,1137
Charybdis,Goodness what a troublesome master you are. Where have you been? I've been waiting to continue cleaning your ears~,1137
Charybdis,This room is brimming with Dragon Empery style. Hmm I'm not exactly sure how to explain it but it sure is nice and relaxing.,1138
Charybdis,Umm Hmm Oh no I still haven't finished sewing the outfit Aurora requested Dear me,1138
Charybdis,My someone is at the door Oh Master?! Please don't move I'm not done working on your ears yet,1139
Charybdis,Alright Master~ I'll be cleaning your other ear now so please turn around Eek?!,1139
Charybdis,Ah Master please don't move around so much.,1140
Charybdis,Ahhn,1140
Charybdis,The rewards have arrived without any issues. That's a relief~,1141
Charybdis,Your mail's here~ Please make sure you check it afterwards~,1141
Charybdis,*Pats thighs* Master I'm right over here~ Heehee you must be exhausted right~,1142
Charybdis,There's no pampering in store for you bunch only punishment!,1142
Charybdis,Now please allow me to continue pampering you once we return~,1143
Charybdis,Tis a pleasure to see you Master. I am delighted to be your partner for today. Oh I was just trying to sound prim and proper! You don't need to look at me with such pity in your eyes!,1143
Charybdis,Master why don't you take the lead tonight? Heehee~,1144
Charybdis,Ugh We haven't even done that much walking but my feet are already sore Changing into an outfit you're not used to isn't the easiest thing in the world. I wonder if Sirius and Black Prince are hanging in there,1144
Charybdis,By the way Master who did you invite today? Umm it doesn't particularly concern me but Dido absolutely wanted to know.,1145
Charybdis,I wonder why Eagle is holding back so much? We went through the trouble of making all this delicious food so,1145
Charybdis,Did you want to shake your feet out as well?,1146
Charybdis,This outfit makes me pretty irresistible doesn't it?,1146
Charybdis,The letter is right~ over~ here~! You don't see it?,1147
Charybdis,Master~ Ahaha that's right~ I'm always ecstatic to come to the beach~,1147
Charybdis,Phew This salty sea breeze feels wonderful Master. Next time I should bring the other ladies here to Hmm Do you have any ideas for what we should do? Maybe light a bonfire?,1148
Charybdis,Eskimo don't go overboard with your pranks,1148
Charybdis,Master it's shallow over here~ Hwaah?! T-that was a huge wave just now,1149
Charybdis,Clear skies and a refreshing breeze The perfect weather for pampering you Master. Wouldn't you agree~?,1149
Charybdis,I'd love to come back here every year with you Master.,1150
Charybdis,The girls of the commissions team have been swallowed by a whirlpool you know Just kidding~ Look they've returned already.,1150
Charybdis,For the safety and continued victory of my Master I'll head out!,1151
Charybdis,I'll have you know I'm not actually bad at fighting. Heehee~,1151
Chaser,Launching and landing carrier-based planes is a bit of a sensitive topic. You'll end up in hot water if you're not careful.,1152
Chaser,I'm really worried about the escort destroyers. As soon as they see submarines they immediate charge forward. Please remind them to stay in escort formation.,1152
Chaser,This is no way to treat a lady~,1153
Chaser,The girls on commission have returned. I wonder if they managed to pick up any tea leaves along the way.,1153
Chaser,My my at this rate I'm might even catch up to those regular carriers.,1154
Chaser,If I'm chasing you don't think you'll get away so easily haha~,1154
Chaser,Even though I'm an escort carrier I won't lose to the regular aircraft carriers when it comes to ability~,1155
Chaser,Drats my flight deck caught on fire again,1155
Chaser,816 Squadron scramble!,1156
Chaser,My flight deck's on fire! Hurry and put it out!,1156
Chaser,Even though I was born in the Eagle Union I was treated very warmly in the Royal Navy. Belfast even taught me how to make a proper cuppa~,1157
Chaser,Every time I set sail some seagulls will be flying overhead. Legend has it that this signifies a safe journey~ Every time I see these little guys I always feel at ease.,1157
Chaser,This is my specially made Valentine's chocolate be grateful and accept it! It tastes even better when enjoyed with some black tea~,1158
Chaser,Doesn't it feel lonely when you hand over your Valentine's chocolate and bam everything's over? If Valentine's Day is truly a celebration then we've got to enjoy it thoroughly! With that being said why don't we play a little game? You'll get a piece of chocolate for playing and if you win I'll do one thing you ask of me~,1158
Chaser,I decided to try my hand at Sakura Empire-style chocolate this time so I asked them for some pointers. Through trial and error we managed to create this. And if it's not too much trouble would you listen to the full story while you eat it? It'll surely be entertaining.,1159
Chaser,Does this dress from the Dragon Empery not suit me well? Though I was born in the Eagle Union and raised by the Royal Navy my time in the Dragon Empery also left a deep impression upon me. Why don't we have a chat about their profound culture and tea? Hehe~,1159
Chaser,After spending some time in the Empery I started to realise that in addition to black tea I sometimes wanted to enjoy the fragrance of green tea as well.,1160
Chaser,The Dragon Empery's traditional dances seem difficult to learn Eh you'd like to learn them with me? In that case we should be able to learn them in no time~,1160
Chaser,Eh fireworks display? Um I think I'll pass I'm not good around fire.,1161
Chaser,Ahh I stayed up too late last night exchanging stories with the Empery girls so I'm really sleepy,1161
Chaser,Ugh there's this saying that for soldiers both victory and defeat are standard issue.,1162
Chaser,I see you~ Don't think you can run from me!,1162
Chaser,Our work takes us to the far corners of the world. Keeping a game console on hand to stave off boredom is a good idea isn't it?,1163
Chaser,Long Island down to host another raid next time? I want to get some new equipment~,1163
Chaser,Bogue's pitches are way too overpowered No matter how hard I try I can only hit two or three out of ten,1164
Chaser,Jeez games aren't enough for you?,1164
Chaser,All right time for me to grab that high score!,1165
Chen_Hai,How's the port supposed to run when the decisionmaker's seat is vacant? C'mon sit down already.,1165
Chen_Hai,If you're not busy then come here let's play a match of Go? No need to have a turn timer or keep track of winners and losers. Let's just kill some time hehe.,1166
Chen_Hai,Are you deep in thought about something? Or just spacing out? Oh I see. You're trying to look cute hehe.,1166
Chen_Hai,My eyes look a bit scary when I'm thinking about something? How do you know that isn't just one of my many faces?,1167
Chen_Hai,Feign strength if you must feign weakness if you must. Whatever the case do not ever let your enemy see through your trump card.,1167
Chen_Hai,What's the matter? You're not here just to have a little chat are you?,1168
Chen_Hai,You certainly have guts.,1168
Chen_Hai,I must say this behavior is rather unexpected.,1169
Chen_Hai,Don't forget to finish up your missions. When it comes back to bite you it'll already be too late.,1169
Chen_Hai,Mission complete. Now that you've removed another obstacle in front of you what will your next move be?,1170
Chen_Hai,Good job on making it back in one piece. I went over your last battle and while it was excellent overall there are many areas that can still be improved So let's review those right now?,1170
Chen_Hai,The commission fleet is back huh Increasing our stockpiles replenishing our forces adding another card to our hand. A good play indeed.,1171
Chen_Hai,I prefer being the one pulling the strings but fine.,1171
Chen_Hai,The moment the enemies let their guard down–– is the moment you strike!,1172
Chen_Hai,The enemy has lost their will to fight. Heh guess that's all they had to show.,1172
Chen_Hai,Ugh just one move behind While I hate conceding defeat there won't be a next time. Hehe,1173
Chen_Hai,Exploit their weaknesses and catch them by surprise!,1173
Chen_Hai,Nothing ventured nothing gained!,1174
Chen_Hai,Seems like I set the bar too high for you.,1174
Chen_Hai,The more you win the harder it'll be for you to review your own moves objectively. Even if you're winning never forget to continue studying your past experiences.,1175
Chen_Hai,War isn't fair. Backstab your enemy. Think two or three steps ahead of them read their every move. Then BAM! Victory comes just like that. Hehe.,1175
Chen_Hai,I'm starting to get bored of our regular old sessions of Go. Let's spice things up a little bit I know just the thing. How about if you can take a game off me I'll grant you one wish.,1176
Chen_Hai,Oh my how could a seasoned strategist like me make such a silly blunder Hehe in any case congratulations on your win. As promised I'll grant you your one wish. Anything goes. Hehehe,1176
Chen_Hai,What's this? Hehe I didn't expect this sneak attack from you Or rather you're the only person who could pull something like this off. Looking at it that way maybe I had predicted this all along right?,1177
Chen_Hai,This lively Valentine's Day seems to have added some excitement and enthusiasm to an otherwise peaceful port. As for me I suppose I'll watch things unfold from a safe distance hehe. By the way these Western-style chocolates are for you.,1177
Chen_Hai,Well it seems you've found my little hideout. The silence here is a pleasant contrast to the bustle of Valentine's and as good a place as any to seduce you I'd say. Heehee. Now it's time to give you my chocolate and proceed to the next phase of my plan. Perhaps you already know what that is?,1178
Chen_Hai,Oh my you seem to be quite energetic today. I was hoping to be able to bemuse myself with your sleepy expression but alas it was not to be. Hehe~,1178
Chen_Hai,The game of Go has already spread far beyond the Dragon Empery. It is a pity however that regional variations in rules make it difficult to thoroughly enjoy a session.,1179
Chen_Hai,Not all surprise attacks must be executed from behind. For example if I suddenly get right up to your face like this –– doesn't that get your heart racing? Hehe~,1179
Chen_Hai,Even if we're just making small talk the most mundane of moments can become splashed with brilliant colors.,1180
Chen_Hai,It appears you are in need of some special discipline.,1180
Chen_Hai,Even divine beings are not omnipotent For example look you've forgotten to finish a mission.,1181
Chen_Hai,You'd like to challenge me to another match today? Very well but let's up the ante this time. The loser is responsible for deciding how the two of us will spend our time together after the match. I also would like to take my hands off the reins every now and then so I'll try my best to win. Hehe~,1181
Chen_Hai,Did my collection catch your eye? Hehe very well there's a lot more of that in the back room. I wouldn't mind showing you around if you'd like~,1182
Chen_Hai,I already have a worthy opponent in front of me but too bad we don't have a Go board and some pieces to play with Ah but worry not I'll fetch them later.,1182
Chen_Hai,Would you like to try this rotary dial phone? You might not be used to operating something like it so try to be careful not to make mistakes.,1183
Chen_Hai,It would appear that you need a reminder as to who the host is here.,1183
Chen_Hai,Do be mindful of who the host is and who the guest is~,1184
Chen_Hai,A letter arriving at a time like this? Talk about spoiling the mood,1184
Chen_Hai,Yes excellent. Just stick to the plan just as I told you. Oh welcome back. That phone call? It's a secret~,1185
Chen_Hai,During this moment of respite set aside all your plans and calculations. Once you've rested sufficiently you can always pick up where you left off.,1185
Chen_Hai,Few things are more blissful than a refreshing soak on a sweltering day. Your clothes might get wet but don't you think it's well worth it?,1186
Chen_Hai,Come with an open heart and leave fulfilled. Now that you've freed yourself from the shackles of the daily grind clear your mind and enjoy this occasion to the fullest~,1186
Chen_Hai,Hai Chi? I'm sure she's playing in the water with some friends she just met. Did you want to go look for her?,1187
Chen_Hai,Ripples in the water the glow of the autumnal sun and the flickering of rainbows If Hai Tien were here I'm sure I would be hearing one of her poems.,1187
Chen_Hai,What's the matter? If it's about work let's save it for later alright?,1188
Chen_Hai,You're completely soaked with sweat I see the sweltering heat outside must've taken its toll on you. Come in and cool off.,1188
Chikuma,Knowledge is power. Not only in battle but for everything else as well right?,1189
Chikuma,You want to know what people are saying about you? You know if you're that curious I suggest that you dig around a bit yourself.,1189
Chikuma,This is some juicy info here Hm I bet Aoba would love to hear about this~,1190
Chikuma,Just like the eyes on my seaplanes need maintenance our eyes should be maintained properly as well. That way we can make sure they work well when they need to.,1190
Chikuma,If you want some help you should organize the information first.,1191
Chikuma,Are you trying to get my ears to spring up? Hehe~,1191
Chikuma,Mission rewards Lots of things here so I'll leave the accounting to you,1192
Chikuma,There's some new mail for you. Please make sure not to look over any new information.,1192
Chikuma,Good work out there. Why don't you get started on the combat report? This experience will become the foundation for your next victory after all.,1193
Chikuma,Hm According to my seaplanes it seems like the commissions team is almost here.,1193
Chikuma,My reconnaissance abilities have grown even sharper~,1194
Chikuma,I've already seen through your tricks hehe.,1194
Chikuma,As long as the intel is correct victory is guaranteed Ehe,1195
Chikuma,It's because I wasn't able to get enough info on them,1195
Chikuma,Knowledge is the key to victory,1196
Chikuma,This is nothing This won't make me fall behind!,1196
Chikuma,I'm sorry. I'm not sure I can deal with someone like you,1197
Chikuma,Let's see what my seaplanes' eyes have captured for me this time.,1197
Chikuma,Oh are you curious about the intel I've gathered? Mm like how everyone at the port feels about you? Just kidding of course,1198
Chikuma,Mm Even if there's something you really want to know I can't just tell you Right how about this? You listen to one of my requests and I'll tell you one thing you want to know in exchange. Hehehe,1198
Chikuma,Hehe. As payment for the secret I told you you'll be taking me out on a date No refunds allowed of course.,1199
Chikuma,Are you disappointed that I'm not surprised at all? Don't be I really am you know? It's just that I'm so happy it far exceeds any surprise I might've felt~ Hehehe~,1199
Chikuma,Here. Through my Eyes this is the scenery of everyone hard at work making chocolate that you wanted to see. Hehe it would appear that they have not finished their preparations yet Go ahead and take this. This is the meaning of a pre-emptive attack~,1200
Chikuma,Hm~? Are you curious about what I was doing? I was collecting info of course. You unexpectedly have a lot of openings. Hehe~,1200
Chikuma,So about those affection points Mm well I'm maxed out but would you like to find out about some of the other girls? Hehehe.,1201
Chikuma,My what am I going to do with you So what is it that you'd like~?,1201
Chikuma,Your tastes Hehehe there's no way I wouldn't know by now right~,1202
Chikuma,Well whatever you might be worried about let's focus on knocking that mission out together.,1202
Chikuma,Mission rewards? Well Hehe let's check on them together.,1203
Chikuma,Good work out there. Leave the combat report to me. You should relax for a bit. Hehe.,1203
Chikuma,As long as I'm able to gather information with my seaplanes this should be the expected result. Hehe.,1204
Chikuma,Oh are you asking me on a date? Mm~ What should I tell you in return Hehehe how about the place I'd like to go today~?,1204
Chitose,Oh you're here. There's some red bean jelly from Chiyoda on your desk. Feel free to take some.,1205
Chitose,Chiyoda and I are partners in carrying out shrine duties. Even though Chiyoda can be pretty annoying at times there are still times she's fun to be around.,1205
Chitose,Isuzu is quite a scaredy cat but she's a good girl. But even that side of her is cute.,1206
Chitose,Chiyoda always insists on doing my hair this way so I let her. However I always feel a bit apologetic for making her do so much,1206
Chitose,I'm at least confident in my Kagura dancing skills. If you get the chance please come and watch.,1207
Chitose,Who?!  Oh it's you. I thought it was a prank from that pink-haired Union girl.,1207
Chitose,Do you like touching my bangs like Chiyoda does?,1208
Chitose,Here are some more missions. Isn't it bad to let them pile up like this?,1208
Chitose,The mission is complete. That's good.,1209
Chitose,There's a letter addressed to you. Please check it out.,1209
Chitose,I'm glad you're safe I made a protective charm for you and also one for Chiyoda. Please keep it safely inside your clothes.,1210
Chitose,The commission team has returned safely. What a relief.,1210
Chitose,I have to make sure to be careful,1211
Chitose,I'm glad that I was able to be a help to everyone else.,1211
Chitose,We're pulling back. Chiyoda please be safe,1212
Chitose,Attack force surround them!,1212
Chitose,This is bad I hope Chiyoda is alright,1213
Chitose,The one thing I hope I never have to see again is the formation of a decoy fleet,1213
Chitose,I don't dislike having to pamper Chiyoda If anything I might actually find it quite endearing,1214
Chitose,Cooking cleaning even taking care of my things Chiyoda takes care of it all.  Basically it's not that I can't do these tasks. If I put my mind to it I can do it I totally can,1214
Chitose,If that's how you feel about me I'll gladly accept your feelings I'll pray for your safety every day and be your refuge from your daily hardships. I hope you'll come look for me whenever you're feeling troubled because I want to pamper you like I do with Chiyoda,1215
Chitose,As promised I've got you chocolate I made myself. Chiyoda said we should give you ours both at once but I didn't want to – I had a suspicion she'd try to steal my chocolate So keep this meeting between you and me okay?,1215
Chitose,The sun's rays are so harsh I should go look for some awning to hide under,1216
Chitose,Everyone becomes so rowdy when they get to the beach I hope nothing bad happens today. Please may enemy aircraft and volleyballs not come flying our way,1216
Chitose,Isuzu who told you that? There aren't any ghosts here don't worry. Go out and play.,1217
Chitose,Chiyoda's quite the sore loser She's like that even when it comes to building sand castles so I can't even imagine how worked up she'd get over beach volleyball If that pink-haired union girl is our opponent I think I'll just sit out,1217
Chitose,The weather forecast says it'll be clear until the evening Mmn,1218
Chitose,That shaved ice looks really good I guess there's a good reason cold treats are popular in the summer.,1218
Chitose,Did I keep you waiting? It took me an awfully long time to get ready This always happens when Chiyoda isn't around,1219
Chitose,I'm so looking forward to seeing what Chiyoda's going to wear I wanna take a picture with her Yeah we're definitely going to do that.,1219
Chitose,Up at the shrine I use a fan to help out with Yamashiro and Fusou. With enough practice you can do stuff like this! H-how'd that look?,1220
Chitose,Flying cranes are a symbol of good luck Yeah I'm sure that's true! Zuikaku said the same thing.,1220
Chitose,Phew It's sure hard to walk around with these long hems.,1221
Chitose,D-did you want to take a photo?,1221
Chitose,Are you tired? We still have a banquet to go to tonight so you should rest while you still can Oh don't worry about me I can get some rest right here (*blushes*),1222
Chiyoda,I help Chitose out with her Shinto duties sometimes. You know as a shrine maiden. Huh? You think I'd be more of a hindrance?,1222
Chiyoda,Doesn't Chitose have really silky hair that smells just divine? Actually I'm the one who takes care of it everyday.,1223
Chiyoda,Whenever we rehearse the dance with Yamashiro and Fusou some kind of trouble always occurs Like something falling or flying off somewhere. But really? I find it all to be pretty funny!,1223
Chiyoda,Am I so beautiful that I caught your eye? I'm flattered but you should focus on your work for now~,1224
Chiyoda,Yikes?! If you had done this to Chitose instead she'd have turned bright red from embarrassment!,1224
Chiyoda,You know I think it's better to take care of missions as they come in. Yes?,1225
Chiyoda,You took care of the missions? Alright. While you take a break I'm going to go check up on how Chitose's doing.,1225
Chiyoda,Looks like you didn't run into any trouble while I was gone. Hehe it must be thanks to the protective charm I slipped inside your clothes~,1226
Chiyoda,Oooh~ I really want to show the new and improved Chiyoda off to Chitose,1226
Chiyoda,Let's kick some fine enemy butt on this wonderful day!,1227
Chiyoda,Did you see that? Did you see how amazing I was?,1227
Chiyoda,Ugh I want to bury my face in Chitose's jugs,1228
Chiyoda,It's my grand entrance!,1228
Chiyoda,Chitose save me,1229
Chiyoda,Y-yeah I I guess I've gotten pretty close to you What would Chitose say if she saw you pampering me like this? Hm If she saw us like this she'd probably say I love both of you so it's fine. or something. Yeah she'd definitely say something like that! Hahaha!,1229
Chiyoda,Now that you've given me this you're going to be stuck pampering me senseless! You already are? I-I guess that's true Well feel free to request whatever you want from me in exchange!,1230
Chiyoda,I made chocolate with Chitose this year! She's so enchanting when she cooks Anyway here's the chocolate we made together. Chitose was just pampering me before so if you're nice to me too this might just be my best Valentine's ever,1230
Chiyoda,Hmm beach volleyball?  I'll use my powers to turn Saratoga into a holey woman! Ain't that right Chitose?,1231
Chiyoda,The summer sun the sparkling sea Stop lazing around and come play with me already Chitose~,1231
Chiyoda,Oh Yamashiro and her sister came too. Wouldn't it be a good idea to team up with them? Well?,1232
Chiyoda,The glamorous Chiyoda in a swimsuit~! No matter how breathtaking I might look don't just stand there and stare like an idiot. C'mon let's go and play~,1232
Chiyoda,If you're looking for something nice and round I can throw this ball at your face you know?,1233
Chiyoda,It's not like I was aiming for your face you know? My hand just happened to slip and the ball just happened to make contact with your face C'mon get over it. It's just an inflatable ball anyway!,1233
Chkalov,Oh so you're a real workhorse. Suppose I'll really have to apply myself as your secretary then.,1234
Chkalov,You're not just here to chat are you? If you've got something important to say spit it out. Just don't expect me to respond right away because I'm busy.,1234
Chkalov,Ugh Wish there was some vodka in here Your office is so much stricter than my lab when it comes to rules and the like.,1235
Chkalov,I'm curious – based on what criteria do you choose a secretary? Surely it's not just good looks? But if it is don't be afraid to admit it,1235
Chkalov,I'd appreciate it if you'd let me handle data analysis in addition to office work. Work is boring but I can stick to it longer when it involves something I'm good at.,1236
Chkalov,What's up? Want me to get you some coffee?,1236
Chkalov,Need to vent some stress do you? Heehee,1237
Chkalov,Here are some mission instructions for you. I can do overtime if it's for science but I'd rather not for this type of work.,1237
Chkalov,Mission complete. Maybe I'll get to return to my lab early today,1238
Chkalov,Back safe and sound I see. Here's the after-action report with all the data sorted out. I'll leave the debriefing to you.,1238
Chkalov,Commission complete. That's all she wrote. Nothing special.,1239
Chkalov,Well that's one way of doing it.,1239
Chkalov,Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty.,1240
Chkalov,Done already? Then let's get moving. We're not getting paid to stand around.,1240
Chkalov,Tsk I hate writing self-improvement reviews,1241
Chkalov,How's this?,1241
Chkalov,You're making this harder than it needs to be!,1242
Chkalov,I'm actually curious as to how someone can keep failing over and over. You are an awful outlier.,1242
Chkalov,Ah! Another blackout. Yeah it's a problem with my lab not the port itself. All my tinkering has made the power really unstable. Just make yourself at home and wait for the lights to come back.,1243
Chkalov,A ring huh So you'll be indebted to me if I accept it – is that right? Then I'll gladly take it. Sharing a special relationship with you works out nicely because it makes it easier to examine your mind and body,1243
Chkalov,What's that? You want chocolate? Oh so it is Valentine's Day. Hmmm Alright then. Pay for the materials and I'll make you exactly that much chocolate. And I mean exactly We don't want either side getting a raw deal.,1244
Chkalov,I've been waiting for you. Today's schedule includes office work your examination and I think that's it. Want to go for lunch once we're done?,1244
Chkalov,Hey you're not making any progress with your work. Don't hesitate to tell me if I'm distracting you. Heehee,1245
Chkalov,*sigh* Another request from Kronshtadt. What is it with her? Always demanding stuff from people – unlike you.,1245
Chkalov,Ah how about we go on a rejuvenating walk?,1246
Chkalov,You're excited I see,1246
Chkalov,Mission complete. Here's hoping you'll finish your work soon enough.,1247
Chkalov,Seems you made it home with no injuries. Externally anyway How do you feel? Do you feel you have a headache or any stomach pains? No? Then all is good.,1247
Chkalov,The commission team is back. With info on that date spot I had them check out to boot. Heehee.,1248
Chkalov,Oh? What made you come over here instead of heading down to the beach? Surely you didn't ditch your friends on a hard-earned day off just to see me? But I don't mind. It's called a day off because you get to decide how to spend your time.,1248
Chkalov,Hanging out basking in the sunset's glow together It's pretty nice wouldn't you say?,1249
Chkalov,I've pinned down your swimsuit preferences after tracking your eyes and analyzing your phrasing when asked for feedback. Heehee.,1249
Chkalov,Still hard at work? You're hardly treating this like a vacation day. No no I know it's for the sake of all of us. You can expect a little something from me later.,1250
Chkalov,Seeing Northern Parliament girls take off their winter coats and put on skimpy swimwear must be a real treat. For you that is.,1250
Chkalov,I feel this occasion calls for a bottle of vodka.,1251
Chkalov,Come and give Ms. Chkalov a hug! Heehee,1251
Chkalov,I hope inspiration will hit me as we go through these missions.,1252
Chkalov,You look like you had a blast back there. I recommend getting some rest.,1252
Chkalov,Will you let me examine your body later as a reward? No?,1253
Choukai,Shall we go for a stroll before the sun goes down?,1253
Choukai,Good work out there on your sortie. I'll handle the reports so please take this time to get some rest.,1254
Choukai,Military commission complete. Rewards received Aye! I've recorded everything!,1254
Choukai,Fleet status confirmed prepare to open fire!,1255
Choukai,Let's triumphantly return home in high spirits!,1255
Choukai,I can still fight! I don't want to lose anyone ever again!,1256
Choukai,My kindness is reserved for my friends only!,1256
Choukai,I can still keep going!,1257
Choukai,There's no need to worry about you just focus on what I'm doing? Alright! Then please watch your feet,1257
Choukai,Lalala~ I feel so motivated just from having you by my side! Um I'm not really sure if the extra motivation affects the quality of my work but it's fine as long as you're pleased with my work~,1258
Choukai,Astoria's outfit's design is a bit out there but is that the kind of outfit you prefer?,1258
Choukai,If you're done with work I'll see you off to the room.,1259
Choukai,Watch out for the floor? Did something happen? Wah?!,1259
Choukai,Eep?!,1260
Choukai,The mission rewards have arrived! I wonder if I should leave them for Maya to take but I am a bit concerned,1260
Choukai,The list of bounty we received from commissions? Sure! I'll bring it along with the menu!,1261

Cleveland,Onward!,1267
Cleveland,Sorry my sisters are waiting for me. I don't have time to deal with you.,1268
Cleveland,Mm I'm not trying to make myself look stronger than I am or anything but honestly I think there aren't many people like you who I can speak to like an equal,1268
Cleveland,Before I realized it I'm the one who's leaning on your shoulder instead but hey that's fine. We can always just rely on each other.,1269
Cleveland,I feel like I've told you everything about myself Time sure flies doesn't it I doubt someone who understands me the way you do will ever show up again. That's why I've,1269
Cleveland,Heh I had a feeling this would happen! From now on you can tell me anything. I'll take excellent care of you!,1270
Cleveland,Just saying but I totally made this chocolate on my own! This way everyone else can focus on their own instead of helping me with mine you know? But anyway give it a taste later!,1270

Cleveland,I've never cuddled with someone like this before It might take some getting used to but I still like it. Hehehe~,1274
Cleveland,N-no probs! I'm ready for this! So just go ahead and umm y-you know,1274
Cleveland,Here's your mail. Give it a look later.,1275
Cleveland,Okay just leave everything to me! I know just how much force to put into my grip to make you feel good!,1275
Cleveland,To think I'd ever get to put on these clothes and spend my joyful time with the person I love (Hug) I guess being a girl really is pretty sweet. Hehehe~,1276
Cleveland,Heheh~ Gimme some candy!,1276
Cleveland,If we the plow the fields now and add some fertilizer then by next year's Halloween we can eat some homegrown pumpkins! Let's do it!,1277

Cleveland,The bonsai tree I planted last year doesn't seem to have grown much I'll have to tend to it better this year.,1282
Cleveland,It's hard to move around in this outfit how do the Sakura girls make it look so effortless?,1282
Cleveland,Helena was the one who drew the design on this paddle. Hehe isn't it sweet?,1283
Cleveland,Ahh Denver wait up! Didn't we agree that the loser has to do the winner's bidding?!,1283
Cleveland,Isn't it real exciting visiting a place you don't normally get to go? We don't often get opportunities to travel like this so let's go look for delicious food and spectacular scenery!,1284
Cleveland,The coral reefs and the huge rock formations are easily the highlights so far. They really make you appreciate the beauty of Mother Nature!,1284
Cleveland,Koalas kangaroos quokkas Hm? Why'd they name this bandicoot Crash?,1285
Cleveland,Mmm this place makes killer steaks! Better not post this on Juustagram though or Yuudachi will get jealous and complain 'cause she doesn't get any.,1285
Cleveland,The mood is there but there's onlookers around so yeah.,1286
Colorado,My poor sisters were hurt on that humiliating day. One day I will have those invaders pay for what they have done!,1286

Colorado,Happy Valentine's Day. This is a day for love and intimacy rather than remembrance and sadness At any rate I made you some chocolate. It's not much but I poured my heart into it.,1292
Colorado,Are you gonna be okay with all that chocolate? I figured you'd be getting a lot from all the other girls and wouldn't be able to finish it all but I still want you to have this. I hope I'm not bothering you,1292
Colorado,I'm back. Phew Just in time for Valentine's too. Here are some gifts from me my sisters and the other Big Sevens along with the stuff you asked for and of course chocolate. Now I can catch a break and whisper you my song of love.,1293

Columbia,I wonder why Cleve suddenly started to make chocolate for everyone this year Well knowing her I'm sure it's just her way of looking out after us.,1308
Columbia,What this sketch? Just a little doodle I made during class. What do you think? Looks like her doesn't it?,1309
Columbia,There's a rule at my school that you're not allowed to chew gum during class. I get it and all but isn't that a total drag?,1309
Columbia,I'm actually wearing two socks today? You pay attention to the weirdest stuff~,1310

Columbia,What am I writing about? It's a secret so you'll just have to guess~,1313
Columbia,Are you getting all touchy-feely 'cause I'm wearing socks on both feet today? Or is it something else~?,1313

Columbia,Feast your eyes! This is the power of a Cleveland-class cruiser!,1314
Columbia,That was easy! Didn't even break a sweat.,1315
Conte_di_Cavour,Save your breath. Let's begin today's work.,1315
Conte_di_Cavour,Leonardo da Vinci had that tragedy not occurred she surely would've fought to the last breath for the glory of the Sardegna Empire just like Cesare.,1316
Conte_di_Cavour,A gown? I have no interest in things like that. Nor will I ever.,1316
Conte_di_Cavour,Some people used to hold me to lofty expectations but it feels natural to see the next generation surpass me.,1317
Conte_di_Cavour,Allow me to say this: judging people by their appearance will be your downfall.,1317
Conte_di_Cavour,Just how little do you think of me?,1318
Conte_di_Cavour,One more name off my list Oh I was talking about the list of unfinished missions.,1318
Conte_di_Cavour,New mail has arrived I'm not your butler and you're perfectly capable of getting it yourself. Look it's by your right hand.,1319
Conte_di_Cavour,A hard fought battle. Next there are many missions that you must attend to Oh my it would appear that I've accidentally finished everything. Do have some tea and rest for a while.,1319

Conte_di_Cavour,As one of Sardegna's veterans I have ample experience ranging from communication to fleet management. If you need any advice feel free to ask me.,1324
Conte_di_Cavour,Long live the glory of the Sardegna Empire Forget it it's all in the past now. I'm getting used to being in this fleet so let's look ahead.,1324
Conte_di_Cavour,I said let's look ahead right? In that case I'll cover your back. That way no matter what happens you can always keep your eyes ahead of you and leave the rest to me.,1325
Conte_di_Cavour,You're giving such an important thing to me? I this is ahh! I'm sorry I can't keep my composure but I'll try my best to say it I do! How's that? P-please let this embarrassing ritual be over already,1325
Conte_di_Cavour,Do you want to hear the story about how Valentinus evolved into Valentine's Day? From a saint's martyrdom to a holiday about giving out sweets really makes you think about how things change over time Ah but before that I have some chocolate for you.,1326
Conte_di_Cavour,Well if you're so desperate for some chocolate from me I guess I'll have to respond in kind. Don't think too hard about it just thankfully accept it as a token of affection from me to you.,1326
Conte_di_Cavour,I've told you before right? This is a crystallization of my love for you. Heh if the size of this chocolate grows in proportion with my feelings for you maybe one day it'll become even bigger than me! Or not haha~,1327
Conte_di_Cavour,The manifestation of love can grow in both size and number. Likewise my gifts of chocolate will grow year after year. There's nothing strange about that now is there?,1327
Conte_di_Cavour,Curses I can't believe people are seeing me in this soggy ugly mess What I'm cute? Wh-what kind of sick joke is that? Come help me already!,1328
Conte_di_Cavour,It's always the normally quiet types that end up making the boldest statements at the beach,1328
Conte_di_Cavour,Huh?! Where'd that sneak attack come from? I've gotta answer back!,1329
Conte_di_Cavour,Cesare this is the only time we'll be fighting on the same front. Let's do this!,1329
Conte_di_Cavour,Not as much as a damn molehill on this beach Where's a soldier supposed to hide herself?,1330
Conte_di_Cavour,You've helped me a lot. Thank you.,1330
Conte_di_Cavour,Y-you traitor!,1331

Cooper,It's finally here! Yes Valentine's Day! I heard if I give you some chocolate you'll give me anything I want in return! Ehehe but don't worry about that. That's not why I'm giving you chocolate~,1338
Cooper,Valentine's has come! Shut up and take my chocolate! And in return Yeah I wanna nap! That's right! Since you're always so tired you me and a kitty are all gonna nap in a cuddle pile!,1339

Cooper,A black kitty cat! Where is it?! Hey now don't distract me!,1341
Cooper,Y-you probably shouldn't touch me. I'm all sweaty right now.,1341
Cooper,Wait up! Hold on! Gotta catch my breath! Phew whew,1342
Cooper,Deuce! This ain't over!,1342
Cooper,Whew! It's freezing cold outside but warm and cozy in here! Nothing beats an open fireplace in the winter~,1343
Cooper,You'd be surprised how easy wrapping presents is! You just put it like this take some wrapping paper then a ribbon aaand done!,1343
Cooper,Man I wish I could ride anywhere in a cool snowmobile like Minneapolis. It's too dangerous for a kid to ride? Hey! It's not like I'm a little baby or anything!,1344
Cooper,Are you feeling chilly? Come a little closer if you wanna warm up then~,1344
Cooper,Hrmph You're not fooling me with any just wanted to warm my hands up excuses!,1345
Cooper,New mail huh? You think it might be someone's Christmas wishlist?,1345
Cooper,I'm not sure who'll end up getting this snowglobe but I am sure they'll love it!,1346
Cooper,I think the commission team's back. Let's invite them in here and we can all have a cozy Christmas together!,1346
Curacoa,A fly? Don't worry they'll disappear after a few moments~,1347
Curacoa,To have a junior as exceptional as Belfast I have to redouble my efforts~,1347
Curacoa,If there is anything you need please call for me right away~,1348
Curacoa,Are you trying to flirt with me? Perhaps there might be a better place for that.,1348
Curacoa,It's not good to let missions pile up. Should I plan them out for you?,1349
Curacoa,Mail has arrived. There appears to be no bad news anyway.,1349
Curacoa,Good work during the sortie. Want to take a breather so you can think about your next step? There's plenty of time to spare so make sure to cherish your health.,1350
Curacoa,Shall I greet the girls who are returning from commissions?,1350
Curacoa,My anti-air capabilities have been upgraded. Great~!,1351
Curacoa,We'll carry forth our tradition of meeting our enemies head-on. Let's charge forward heroically!,1351
Curacoa,To think that I'd get MVP sorry about that~,1352
Curacoa,I've been thoroughly discredited,1352
Curacoa,Please be at ease. I shall always be here~,1353
Curacoa,It's do or die I have to go all out!,1353
Curacoa,My apologies but I believe it would be best if we maintained some distance.,1354
Curacoa,Would you like some snacks? My old students used to love these - please have some.,1354
Curacoa,Master would you like to taste the chocolate that my sister and I made for you? Even Curlew who is normally strict with sweets will be willing to overlook it just for Valentine's Day. If you need a little bit of sweetness just let me know all right~?,1355
Curacoa,Wouldn't you say a break is in order Master? You've been working since noon Excellent I thought you'd agree. Then allow me to offer you my handmade chocolate. Given that it's Valentine's Day I'm sure Curlew will be a little more forgiving with you. Still I kindly suggest that you eat it slowly. Okay? Hehehe.,1355
Curacoa,I come with Valentine's chocolate Master Oh is something the matter? You come across a bit absentminded. Did Curlew lecture you on proper etiquette when receiving chocolate? Heehee. Don't stress over it. Manners aren't important – feelings are. She's only trying to say she loves you just as I do.,1356
Curacoa,It is my honour to be of everyone's service. Light cruiser Curacoa takes it upon herself to continue serving you Master.,1356
Curacoa,If you're still agonizing over today's itinerary why not have have a cup of tea and reset yourself?,1357
Curacoa,Curley is always walking around with that stony expression Maybe she and I have a different understanding of how a maid ought to present herself?,1357
Curacoa,Seeing everyone's growth and maturity somehow puts my mind at ease.,1358
Curacoa,My abilities as an anti-air escort? Why it's my next best thing after being a maid of course.,1358
Curacoa,Being in a room that has been cleaned properly will also clean your mind of distractions.,1359
Curacoa,You may give me orders at any time Master.,1359
Curacoa,Why don't we save these kinds of things for after work?,1360
Curacoa,This outfit's design is rather bold I'm more accustomed to my maid uniform,1360
Curacoa,My obligations as a maid do not end when I am not in my uniform. If you need anything just let me know.,1361
Curacoa,Everyone is busy with Spring Festival preparations but I'd like to take this opportunity to slack off a little~,1361
Curacoa,You'd like to know if there are any secrets behind the Dragon Empery's culinary and artistic crafts? Hehe stay tuned~,1362
Curacoa,Holidays in the Dragon Empery seem to have a lot of complicated customs. Perhaps they are comparable with a Royal maid's code of etiquette? Hehe~,1362
Curlew,No matter the time or place as a maid or as a soldier one must always remember to observe proper etiquette.,1363
Curlew,Royal etiquette is steeped in social and life philosophy. Please keep that in mind at all times.,1363
Curlew,I already am a perfect maid? Surely you jest have you not met my elder sister yet?,1364
Curlew,Please be mindful of your posture. Be confident and stand tall so that you can earn the respect of others.,1364
Curlew,A new mission has been posted. Please complete it as soon as possible - it's rude to keep others waiting.,1365
Curlew,This mail is for you. Don't worry I'll be sure to leave when you are ready to check it.,1365
Curlew,Let's show our enemies what a Royal maid is capable of.,1366
Curlew,As long as you strive for excellence victory will naturally follow.,1366
Curlew,It appears that I need to have higher expectations of myself.,1367
Curlew,I shall correct your perversion!,1367
Curlew,T-trigger the anti-air defence alarm!,1368
Curlew,To think that there would be people who cannot comprehend Royal etiquette at all,1368
Curlew,Please do not blame me for being too strict. Royal etiquette is not something can be easily mastered.,1369
Curlew,Just like libations there is a time and place for drinking black tea. What you want to have tea right now? F-fine.. since it's been so long since you've had a break I suppose there's no harm to it,1369
Curlew,Being with you reminds me of the time I used to live with my sister. She'd always instruct me on how to be a prim and proper maid. I wonder if I've managed to become an excellent maid just like her,1370
Curlew,Since I have already made my oath with you it would be improper if I was the only one instructing you. What would I like you to teach me? Master can you please teach me the etiquette of love?,1370
Curlew,Master I am quite confident about everything regarding this chocolate. Perhaps the only thing I did not add enough of would be my love but if you happen to enjoy the chocolate by all means please do tell me.,1371
Curlew,Master while these chocolates can certainly stand on their own you may want to have some tea with them Sigh I know you're eager to eat but one should still consider basic etiquette.,1371
Curlew,Master it is important to provide your brain with ample glucose to carry out your duties but be sure to keep in mind the pride and propriety of your post. Here is some chocolate my sister and I made I'll make an exception for Valentine's Day yes.,1372
Curlew,It should be expected that one who manages an entire port would accept a woman's Valentine's chocolate without fuss no? Regardless of if she's a Royal Maid or not. (By the way kindly tell me if you'd rather eat it later. We all know how hard you work and how busy you are Master.),1372
Curlew,It is unavoidable that you'll be flooded with gifts of chocolate Master. Ideally you accept them without causing a breach of etiquette So I must ask why the unrefined expression Master? Furthermore does Curacoa have anything to do with it?!,1373
Curlew,I am now more capable than ever of demonstrating the Royal Maids' style. Though I am not as talented as my sister Curacoa I sincerely hope you will find my service satisfactory. It is a great honour to work for you.,1373
Curlew,I am now more capable than ever of demonstrating the Royal Maids' style. Though I am not as talented as my sister Curacoa I sincerely hope you will find my service satisfactory. It is a great honour to work for you.,1374
Curlew,You've noticed my new fittings? Don't worry they will not impact the execution of my duties as a maid.,1374
Curlew,To improve is to change. To be perfect is to change often One should bear this quotation in mind.,1375
Curlew,Maintaining this new equipment takes significantly more time. I suppose that's the price of strength.,1375
Curlew,To study etiquette is to pursue knowledge. Only in properly managing oneself is one fit to lead others Let's move forward together Master.,1376
Curlew,I've made some adjustments to my outfit as suggested by the others. What do you think Master?,1376
Curlew,M- Master what are you Aie?!,1377
Curlew,You must be exhausted. I have prepared today's tea with your comfort in mind. A maid must always be aware of her master's condition as well as mood. Relax and enjoy. Hehehe.,1377
Curlew,You can feel the profound heritage and culture of the Dragon Empery from all these customs and outfits for the Lunar New Year's Festival It seems to be ever more necessary to study the traditions and etiquette of this wondrous culture.,1378
Curlew,Etiquette is closely linked to culture so it's no surprise that there are many differences between the Royal Navy and the Dragon Empery.,1378
Curlew,The girls from the Empery said that they'd be willing to teach me a few New Year's greetings. Once I've learned them I'll be able to give you some blessings!,1379
Curlew,For a Royal maid like myself to don the attire of the Dragon Empery isn't this what cultural exchange is all about?,1379

Dido,Master am I wasting your precious time? Please forgive me! I am almost ready!,1437

Dorsetshire,It's not an exaggeration to say my sister is a world treasure a gift from the heavens. It's an honor for me to have a sister like her.,1449
Dorsetshire,Ah could it be that you've developed feelings beyond friendship for me? In that case I must properly respond to them.,1449
Dorsetshire,I've perfectly replicated my cute little Norfolk's chocolate from the technique all the way to the ingredients. Imitation is the highest form of flattery as they say! And now I offer this gift to you and everyone else! Please take it!,1450
Downes,Oh? Do you fancy girls with a bit of muscle? Girls like me?,1450
Downes,Tsk! I'm so bored~ I wanna blow something up!,1451
Downes,My magazine's too easy to hit? It's fine one day or another it'll blow up anyway!,1451
Downes,Ah that's the spot right there~,1452
Downes,You looking to get bitten?,1452
Downes,Looks like you've got some unfinished missions!,1453
Downes,Alright let's go fetch those rewards!,1453
Downes,Yo! You've got mail!,1454
Downes,Everyone is back! When are we taking off again?,1454
Downes,A commission has been completed Hey are there any commissions where we can blow stuff up?,1455
Downes,Hey I really want to make something violently explode right now!,1455
Downes,Let's go girls! Show them what we've got!,1456
Downes,Weaklings do you know Downes' power now?,1456
Downes,Ow ow ow My magazine's been,1457
Downes,Eat this!,1457
Downes,There's nothing I hate more than the listless!,1458
Downes,My body? Don't pay it any attention. I've only had half of it replaced. I can still eat and sleep just fine. Nothing's wrong!,1458
Downes,Babam! Here's my handmade titan-class ginormous chocolate bar! Cassin might have quantity but I've got quality! Quality is about taste not sheer size? Hey size is king baby! It's like with guns – the bigger the better am I right?,1459
Downes,Yo! Talk about being early! C'mere and gimme a hand stocking these shelves.,1459
Downes,Hahahah! Whaddya think of my little creation here? Oh and don't tell Akashi about it!,1460
Downes,I reckon I can make an explosive out of stuff lying around the store! Look I'm just saying it's possible!,1460
Downes,This fella's almost past its expiration date Heheh. Should we ask Akashi for permission to do an inventory sweep?,1461
Downes,What'd I tell you – two heads are more productive than one!,1461
Drake,You've finally come. What should we start with today? It's great to think about battle plans and all but how about sending me on a sortie first?,1462
Drake,All great odysseys must begin somewhere but true glory only awaits those who reach their destination That's why you ought to stay your course until the very end!,1462
Drake,Basically ships arm themselves with armor and equipment—in other words with artillery and torpedoes. Meanwhile humans arm themselves with courage and intelligence—in other words with perception and wisdom.,1463
Drake,While I don't hate customs and ceremony I do prefer the simpler things.,1463
Drake,The dew-kissed fruit of the morning makes for the best juice. Don't you agree?,1464
Drake,I tend to get along better with people who are straightforward. If there's something you want to say to me say it clearly.,1464
Drake,Huuh? You sure have some guts.,1465
Drake,Doing mundane tasks is totally not my style. Um Why don't we check the rewards first?,1465
Drake,Can't complain about the bounty but I just feel like there's something missing.,1466
Drake,Here a letter for you. Anybody find information on some treasure?,1466
Drake,Instead of collecting supplies like this wouldn't it be better to just raid the enemy for Actually never mind.,1467
Drake,Now that's the kind of sound I want to hear from my main guns! Ahahaha!,1467
Drake,Alright let's do this with fanfare!,1468
Drake,Victory always leaves you feeling nice and refreshed!,1468
Drake,How humiliating I'll get you back for this! Just you wait!,1469
Drake,You won't find any mercy here!,1469
Drake,Ugh they got me!,1470
Drake,I am willing to turn a blind eye to a few accidents but if you keep doing this intentionally don't expect any mercy from me.,1470
Drake,Everything goes on the battlefield. Whether you fight fair-and-square or use backhanded methods it matters not. History is written by the victors.,1471
Drake,Sure it's great to travel together and all but aren't all these places too close by? Port the surrounding areas and the nearby ocean Sigh. Honestly going to these places doesn't make me excited at all. Next time I'm taking you somewhere farther away.,1471
Drake,I see. So what you're telling me is that it's not the place that matters but that if I'm with you anywhere is fine?  Haha W-Wait are you saying,1472
Drake,Don't you think it's strange too? This feeling that's not quite 'having my heart stolen' or 'feeling vexed' but more just 'feeling embarrassed'? Gosh it's all your fault that I'm not acting like myself!  But I don't quite hate this feeling either Well? Do you get what I mean?,1472
Drake,All right I got my hands on some limited-time chocolate! Now let's take a look at today's loot–– No way! I'm not in the mood to share with you right now Yeah let's enjoy things slowly after we get back!,1473
Drake,I mean yes of course I wanted to improve my artillery and torpedoes get thicker plating and improve my engines—but it's too expensive to do so.,1473
Drake,How'd you like some lime juice? Yes I do think fresh juice is the best and you're gonna need to get used to it when you're sailing the high seas. Hehe~,1474
Drake,Hey What do you think you're doing while the sun's still up,1474
Drake,Hm I see. This is what it feels like to be loved by someone you love. Not wanting to snatch someone away or wanting to monopolize them but feeling excited and safe It feels a bit strange,1475
Drake,Phew Swimming like this doesn't feel all that refreshing Hey how about you stop staring and come join me?,1475
Drake,I heard this is a nice place to swim. Imagine my surprise to learn it wasn't a beach but an outdoor pool Still I guess if we're just killing time this is as good a place as any,1476
Drake,Artificial waves? Hmm this might be more fun than I thought. Time to show off my swimming skills!,1476
Drake,C-could you stop staring at me like that? You're starting to weird me out,1477
Drake,Hahah seems like this manjuu needs some more practice if it's struggling with these meager waves!,1477
Drake,*sigh* I'm not feeling satisfied yet. Guess I'll go for another swim,1478
Drake,Ooh my shoulders were starting to get a little stiff. You're not half-bad eh~,1478
Drake,Good exercise followed by some exquisitely cool watermelon man it's just the best! Hey you'd better get over here and have a bite or I'll finish this whole thing by myself!,1479
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,I am the final development from a class of treaty cruiser. With the performance enhancements I recieved victory is but guaranteed in any battle I partake in.,1479
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,It matters not how strong your adversary is as long as you are stronger. That is what war boils down to.,1480
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Hmm. Climb Mount Niitaka? I see I'm not alone in the desire to mountaineer What? That's not what the message means?,1480
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,What has gotten into you?!,1481
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Say the word and I will complete these missions for you.,1481
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Mission complete. It's time you looked over the rewards.,1482
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,You have a letter. Whoever wrote it is brutishly uncourteous It's what? From Naval HQ? I see.,1482
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Now the question is how to make the best use of my new abilities?,1483
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,To battle! My splendor shall be proven!,1483
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,I am the Empire's splendor – Duca degli Abruzzi! Etch this name into your memories!,1484
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Alas we must shamefully turn our backs on our foes,1484
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Witness my full potential!,1485
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,As long as I can still fight I will!,1485
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,You've proven yourself a spineless imbecile. Get out of my sight!,1486
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,My name is Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi. You find that too hard to memorize? Then you may shorten it to Duca degli Abruzzi but no less than that. My dignity won't allow it.,1486
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Don't fret over each and every obstacle you face Commaner. Your subordinates will do all in their power to help.,1487
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,This ring could only mean one thing. You want my support till death do us apart no? Then I will oblige. After all there is no greater joy than knowing you want me by your side forever. Hahaha.,1487
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Care for some tea before work? I'll put the kettle on.,1488
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,I truly do hope to see you at Le Triomphant's tea party. Feel free to ask if you want suggestions on what gifts you should bring.,1488
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,You're not procrastinating but rather taking a break? I wish you would've said so sooner. Forgive me if I've been excessively strict. Let us both work on our undesirable quirks.,1489
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Your presence has lifted a great burden from my shoulders. The energy it has freed up I will use to better myself.,1489
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,I don't blame you for losing control but you must consider the impact on your public image.,1490
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,You have been defeated by the one and only Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi! Remember this fact!,1490
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Fixated on my younger sister hmm? You lend credibility to the adage that heroism breeds virility. Hahah!,1491
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,What do you think of this neon-lit cityscape? It doesn't start to compare to the idyllic vistas of Sardegna but it has its own merits.,1491
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,You truly are dependable to the utmost obliging my younger sister with your company like this.,1492
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Valiant? I'm not sure where she is. Which is concerning as I don't believe she's a good swimmer,1492
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Enjoy your time here. Let others take care of any bothersome chores in the meantime.,1493
Duca_degli_Abruzzi,Is the water temperature satisfactory? You must not come here much so make the most of your visit. If you want something just ask for it.,1493
Dunkerque,There are things in this world that you might never be able to accomplish but that is no reason to give up hope.,1494
Dunkerque,What am I going to do with you,1494
Dunkerque,There's no shortage of new missions for us to get through Hard work is important and all but let's not overwork ourselves.,1495
Dunkerque,Oh my it looks like the commission fleet has returned. Perfect timing - I'll invite them to try my new confections.,1495
Dunkerque,Every little bit matters.,1496
Dunkerque,Apologies. I have no mercy to spare for my enemies.,1496
Dunkerque,Let's keep up this pace.,1497
Dunkerque,T'en fais pas a defeat here is not the end.,1497
Dunkerque,Let's do it just like we practiced!,1498
Dunkerque,I'm only getting warmed up,1498
Dunkerque,Everyone looks like they're having so much fun I couldn't ask for anything more.,1499
Dunkerque,Ice-cream based desserts are delicious but they melt too easily I might have to bring a cooler with me next time,1499
Dunkerque,It's been a long time since I last was able to enjoy scenery like this without any worries,1500
Dunkerque,Want to try gazing into the ocean horizon together? It always puts my mind at ease.,1500
Dunkerque,Enemies? Way to spoil the scenery,1501
Dunkerque,Who wants to have some crullers? I made more than enough for everyone~,1501
Dunkerque,Don't you simply adore the atmosphere in this place? It's one of my favorites. The desserts here are to die for. Would you like a taste?,1502
Dunkerque,Is it a very important mission? Well then I'll go with you.,1502
Dunkerque,We have new intelligence? Well don't worry about me. Please check it at once.,1503
Dunkerque,The warm sunlight the peaceful atmosphere the soothing music all embracing me as I relax and chat with one so dear to me. If this is a dream I hope to never wake up,1503
Eagle,There are many Royal Navy ships named Eagle and I will go great lengths to maintain its honourable reputation.,1504
Eagle,Let's see what's on the menu today Fruits and a vegetable salad. Ideal for a low-calorie diet.,1504
Eagle,How much do I weigh? Ahem you'd better drop this topic or else! Okay I'm just exaggerating. But I hope you understand that it's a sensitive topic for me.,1505
Eagle,A band of Iron Blood submarines ran away before I could as much as say hello. Again Guess I'll have to come up with a good way of approaching them.,1505
Eagle,What is it? An invitation to get lunch? Hmm Sorry but could you go in my place?,1506
Eagle,You see this is the reason why we have to teach people proper etiquette.,1506
Eagle,There's mail for you. Don't forget to give it a look.,1507
Eagle,Commission complete. Let's go and offer the returning team some biscuits. Don't worry about me I can do without.,1507
Eagle,Enhancements huh I just wish they wouldn't affect my weight,1508
Eagle,The battlefield Heh I'm getting all fired up!,1508
Eagle,To show compassion to your foe is to put the safety of your allies at risk.,1509
Eagle,Tsk I've taken damage after fighting for so long I'll need repairs when we return.,1509
Eagle,You're mine!,1510
Eagle,A warrior of the Royal Navy won't back down so easily!,1510
Eagle,You're betraying everyone's trust in you by acting like this. Pull yourself together for god's sake!,1511
Eagle,People say I'm not great at socializing a fact that I begrudge. But my social skills aside I do know my manners.,1511
Eagle,Despite my low-calorie diet and daily rigorous exercise my weight stays the same *sigh* I guess my past status as a battleship defines me more than I think But why?! How does everyone else manage to lose weight just fine?!,1512
Eagle,You are irreplaceable to me. Whatever becomes of me Scratch that. I'll stay the way I am now just for you. Because I think this is what made me equally irreplaceable to you. Am I right?,1512
Eagle,Even though I made low-calorie chocolate for you considering the amount of Valentine's chocolate you'll probably be getting today I might as well've been trying to light a match in a storm. In any case I've prepared your next month's training regiment as well. Starting tomorrow let's burn those calories and strive for a healthy lifestyle!,1513
Eagle,I've gotten better at talking to all the submarines. Knowing you for so long has helped me substantially improve my social skills.,1513
Eagle,An invitation for lunch eh? With you watching over me I think I can do it. Let's go.,1514
Eagle,Despite my weight I have little meat on my– Wh-what are you doing?!,1514
Eagle,That really hit the spot thank you. No matter how hard the going may get I will always keep advancing for you.,1515
Eagle,Weight and appearances don't bother me as much anymore. We as ships can't physically change much anyway and you're happy with me no matter how I look. We are both irreplaceable to one another after all.,1515
Eagle,Debrief me on your symptoms. Oh that doesn't sound like what a doctor would say? Then how about Do you feel ill?,1516
Eagle,I've come well prepared in hopes of learning the ropes of our infirmary.,1516
Eagle,I've come up with a new healthy diet that improves your physical stamina. Care to give it a try?,1517
Eagle,Treating wounds and saving lives – being a doctor comes with great responsibility but also great pride.,1517
Eagle,Let's take your temperature just to be sure. Mind if I assist with that?,1518
Echo,Wales someone can be small and still have a lot of potential you know! Ehehe Echo doesn't know what that means but maybe they're words of praise~?,1518
Echo,I made a promise to Edinburgh: I must return to port now and then no matter how far away I go~,1519
Echo,Be it with my E-class sisters or strangers I can make friends with anyone I have fun with so don't worry about me!,1519
Echo,Wha? Hood said I shouldn't let people touch me there,1520
Echo,Mail has arrived~ Maybe there are yummy snacks enclosed within it~ Ehehe~,1520

Echo,Lala~ Sweet chocolate makes everyone happy. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we all could rejoice in sweetness every day? As the first step towards that goal I'd like to spend this whole day with you as sweetly as possible!,1524
Edinburgh,Ah! I'm not doing anything weird! I'm just transporting gold bars into the room!,1525
Edinburgh,I'm not going to give these to you no matter how much you stare at me.,1525
Edinburgh,I want to be as elegant as Hood but well,1526
Edinburgh,Eeeh! Bel where are you? I forgot my keys again,1526
Edinburgh,Hmhmm~ Even Scharnhorst had to turn tail and run away when she saw me!,1527
Edinburgh,Hey!! Don't touch that! It's gonna fall!,1527

Edinburgh,Everything goes well when 'that girl' does it so it should be fine if I'm a little clumsy shouldn't it?,1533
Edinburgh,I've been lectured by Bel again Forgetting to lock doors when going out and turning off the tap What the heck! She's totally not like a little sister!,1534
Edinburgh,Hmhm I'm fine with sharing some of my money-luck with you. The gold? No! That belongs to the Belfast Foundation!,1534
Edinburgh,Even if I'm not as multi-talented as Bel I am still able to be of service to you right? Here's your Valentine's chocolate and I can brew you an absolutely splendid pot of tea to go along with it! I can't wait to impress you with my performance! Mhm!,1535
Edinburgh,Have you already tasted Bel's chocolate? Have mine next then! We agreed we'd do it in order remember? You'll get a better sense of my chocolate's qualities if you eat it right after hers!,1535
Edinburgh,Why doesn't she have to go to school with meshe says she’s a maid for the Queen? Well me too! You can be a maid and school girl at the same timetsk tsk---,1536
Edinburgh,This pendant is so cute right?! I copied from that girl. Let's call her “Belfast”.,1536
Edinburgh,Hmmthis Alchemy is really mysterious but once I mastered it then Belfast’s trust fund will,1537
Edinburgh,Belfast wake me up before you wake up Elizabeth. Otherwise she will criticize me for getting up late again,1537
Edinburgh,Do I look like a child who’s so easily bullied? Hehe but as elegant as I am no wonder I am called a fairy.,1538
Edinburgh,Victory let me rub your cheeks again doing so always brings me good luck.,1538
Edinburgh,Belfast before you go to greet the girls returning from commission could you brush my hair? It's a mess,1539
Edinburgh,Tsk tsk we don’t need her here. In any case Belfast will always be by my side. Fleet prepare for interception!,1539

Edinburgh,They're saying I've got spicy candy mixed in here? That's odd I hand picked them all myself Now where did that rumor come from?,1541
Edinburgh,Ta-daaah! It's a special Halloween Maid uniform! Lovely innit? Heheee I'd say bits of me even outshine Bel!,1542
Edinburgh,Gneisenau's costume there it's a bit Um it's something,1542
Edinburgh,Oi there! Don't be doing that when I'm busy!,1543
Edinburgh,Bel are you really turning down the Halloween event because you're too busy with Head Maid duties? Gosh you really ought to make time for your sister~,1543

Elbe,Kneel in front of me! Pretty please,1548
Elbe,It's time for your punishment!,1549
Elbe,I I haven't even gotten serious yet!,1549
Elbe,It turns out you really were an inferior creature all along,1550
Elbe,If I give this kind of work to you you'll surely be very troubled! I-it's fine for me to trouble you?,1550
Elbe,I'm a very bad girl so I'll keep finding new ways to trouble you more and more! Now brace yourself~ Y-you're busy today so I shouldn't? Oh Okay then,1551
Elbe,Here is your Valentine's chocolate! You have a sweet tooth don't you? Guess what – I used tons of cocoa powder and made it quite bitter! You appreciate it since you've gotten so much sweet chocolate already? Uh-huh I see! Isn't that wonderful!,1551
Elbe,I've been thinking Isn't it pretty unusual for you to be the one who always makes coffee for me? I mean even if I'm a bad girl you're still my superior and you can't leave out my sugar on purpose like that!,1552
Elbe,Hehehe I went and swapped around some of the forms you're supposed to work on. Will you finally admit that I'm a bad girl now?,1552
Elbe,Once this war is over maybe I can go back to being a good girl B-but that's only if you promise that you'll always stay with me!,1553
Elbe,As your secretary ship I'll make sure that I work myself to the bone! Now now leave all of your work to me and wallow in your pangs of guilt~,1553

Elbe,If they make you fill out a reflection form for not completing your missions on time leave it to me! Ehehe,1555
Elbe,Here are the mission rewards. Your beaming face is enough to make it worthwhile.,1555
Elbe,I always thought that being a bad girl would keep you interested in me but sometimes I just want to be a good girl who clings to your side O-only every once in a while though got it?,1556
Elbe,Thank you all for waiting! Large mugs of Iron Blood beer just as ord–– W-waaah?! Nnngh! Phew somehow managed to not spill anything Wh-what's your deal?!,1556
Elbe,Master what would you like to order today? Hehehe.,1557
Elbe,You can't find your steak knife? He hehe that's right! It was all me! Now you're going to make me get on my knees before scolding me right? Wait you're just going to leave me here?!,1557
Elbe,It's not good for you to drink so much A-After all I don't know what kind of wild things you might do to me when you're inebriated,1558
Elbe,Eeeeek?!,1558
Elbe,You want to bring the girls some refreshments? Sure hold on for a moment then,1559
Elbe,We won! My time to shine is here!,1559

Elbe,Heheh I will gladly let you carry my things! Where should we go next? Ordo you need a minute to rest?,1561
Elbe,Bwuh?! Did you hear that?!,1561

Elbe,Here are your rewards. Allow me to hold your things for you.,1563
Elbe,Thank you for your continued efforts. Um Wh-why are you looking at me so expectantly?,1563
Elbe,We won! I'm really on fire today!,1564
Elbing,No rain today I assume? I see So there was no point in me bringing an umbrella.,1564
Elbing,It could rain today. You see when I say it's going to rain the weather always turns sunny,1565
Elbing,My rigging is so intimidating Strong though it may be it's no good in the hands of someone helpless like me.,1565
Elbing,After all my efforts there's no less work than when I started But if I give up your workload might increase instead Ughhh,1566
Elbing,Maybe I could help with No I'm good for absolutely nothing.,1566
Elbing,Y-you flatter me,1567
Elbing,I hope this letter has good news for you and bad news for me,1567
Elbing,Welcome back. You came home safe and sound because I wished that you'd get battered and bruised. My wishes never ever come true you see,1568
Elbing,The commission team is back. I'd better not retrieve the rewards or some will magically disappear,1568
Elbing,Why strengthen me of all people?,1569
Elbing,I'll take care to stay out of collision range!,1569
Elbing,I I'm the MVP? You don't have to hold back for my sake I just don't have what it takes to be the MVP,1570
Elbing,Sure enough all battles I partake in end in defeat,1570
Elbing,It won't matter if I can't hit them!,1571
Elbing,W-we're gonna collide!,1571
Elbing,I'll state this upfront: I'm feeble clumsy cursed with terrible luck and I doubt I'll be much of any use to you,1572
Elbing,None of my shells ever land. Even when I take another shot it just misses. All I do is waste ammunition *sigh*,1572
Elbing,You've been kind to me this whole time not because I'm useful but because you pity me isn't that right? I only wish I could do anything in return,1573
Elbing,A promise ring?! B-but that'd make us both happy when I explicitly I see now. The wish must've come true because I wished for your happiness not my own. Thank goodness *sniffle* I'm so glad it came true!,1573
Elbing,I've not made any chocolate for you. If I did the universe would do everything to prevent me from seeing you today. So if I do see you I'll have nothing to give you which is just as bad *sigh* R-really?! YOU'VE brought chocolate for ME?! But are you sure? I don't deserve it at all,1574
Elbing,You think it's going to rain today? I see I brought my umbrella hoping the weather would clear up. H-hopefully this will be a sunny day.,1574
Elbing,Oh gosh! I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have thrown the door open! I thought there's no way you're in here but lo and behold you were standing right at the entrance,1575
Elbing,We should go on a date since it's sunny? Um sure! I'll bring my umbrella to ensure this nice weather sticks around for the whole day!,1575
Elbing,Destroyers usually have cute little riggings Something like what they have would suit me better. Heehee.,1576
Elbing,Is there any way I can help? As long as it's something I can handle and will make your job easier,1576
Elbing,If there's any way I can help I'll try.,1577
Elbing,New mission rewards! I wonder wh-what we've received.,1577
Elbing,Of course your wellbeing is important to me but I try not to think about it. I mean wishing for your safety only puts you in danger. Simply not worrying about you is the best way to ensure nothing bad happens,1578
Elbing,Are you sure you want me to fetch the commission rewards? Items on the list might get lost somehow if I do it,1578
Elbing,I'm going to have an awful day today. It's going to rain the restaurant I booked a table at will close early same for the movie theater after that and you'll receive urgent work that keeps you busy all night That should do it! Thanks for waiting while I recited all that.,1579
Elbing,As the mistress of this manor I c-command thee to kneel No of course. I mean what authority do I have to issue commands? I'm better suited to be a maid than a mistress,1579
Elbing,This is what happens when you stretch your clothes past their limit It's not my fault? Yes it is because I'm a bad fit for this role,1580
Elbing,I'd be helpless even in the role of a maid. All I would do is mess up constantly and be a burden to you,1580
Elbing,At the risk of sounding rude Emden should be doing this not a trainwreck like me.,1581
Elbing,Since we can't fall asleep we could always cuddle together or not I know you'd say no if I Oh we can?,1581
Elbing,I'm worried I might wish for something that negatively affects you in my dreams You doubt my curse extends to my dreams? Maybe not but I'll have forgotten what I wished for once I wake up so you can never be sure,1582
Elbing,S-Sorry Am I too close?,1582
Elbing,I guess I should try to stay still I don't want to bump into you by accident You can change positions if you want. I-I can handle a bump or two,1583
Elbing,If you really can't sleep should I whisper into your ear like Emden did? Alright let me just turn over to Eep!,1583
Elbing,Whew I made a wish that you'd come back dead tired which is why you're full of energy. Although that'll only make it harder for you to fall asleep won't it?,1584
Elbing,The commission team is back? Right yeah I'd forgotten. It's not their bedtime yet.,1584
Elbing,This is either a fluke or I'm dreaming.,1585
Emanuele_Pessagno,You have to take good care of telescope lenses Otherwise they might get scratched up and that's a huge problem.,1585
Emanuele_Pessagno,I like to gaze out into the distant scenery. What your eye can perceive is so much greater than what your fingertips are able to touch.,1586
Emanuele_Pessagno,There should be a lot of great observation spots around the port right? I'd like to jot them all down when I get the chance.,1586
Emanuele_Pessagno,Da Recco if you're going to go out wouldn't it be safer to take a more charted route?,1587
Emanuele_Pessagno,You want to try looking through my telescope? Um sure but be careful,1587
Emanuele_Pessagno,P-please stop that,1588
Emanuele_Pessagno,Is there something wrong with my ribbon?,1588
Emanuele_Pessagno,Here's the mission completion report Need help looking over it? If a typo slipped its way into the final submission,1589
Emanuele_Pessagno,You've got new mail. It's from somewhere I can't see Hrmm someplace far far away?,1589
Emanuele_Pessagno,Oh. Sorry I was taking in the scenery outside and didn't notice you returning,1590
Emanuele_Pessagno,Our friends from the commission team have returned. Look they're over there––,1590
Emanuele_Pessagno,Am I able to see farther now?,1591
Emanuele_Pessagno,Enemy spotted Commencing attack!,1591
Emanuele_Pessagno,Did we manage to win? That's a relief,1592
Emanuele_Pessagno,I see you!,1592
Emanuele_Pessagno,I mustn't drag the others down,1593
Emanuele_Pessagno,I'm sorry but please leave me alone,1593
Emanuele_Pessagno,A telescope makes it possible to see things clearly even from a distance From a place far far away where I won't bother anyone,1594
Emanuele_Pessagno,Imprinting a beautiful scenery into your memory after seeing it once is already good enough But sometimes the more you see something the more you want to touch it feel it,1594
Emanuele_Pessagno,Eh? Th-this is for me? Thank you I'll make sure to treasure it no matter what Ehehe I don't have to keep gazing from a distance anymore After all happiness is within my reach,1595
Emanuele_Pessagno,My telescope can bring the most distant of sceneries right before me but I won't be able to touch them. It's a rather lonely feeling The same goes for people I like,1595
Emanuele_Pessagno,The same scenery can look completely different when sharing it with someone else as opposed to viewing it alone Ehehe maybe I'm not so envious of the others anymore.,1596
Emanuele_Pessagno,I wish there was a telescope that two people could use at once,1596
Emanuele_Pessagno,You know I'm not good with these kinds of things right? (*blushes*),1597
Emanuele_Pessagno,Ehehe I saw you coming back from a long way away. But it still feels more comforting to welcome you in person like this,1597
Emanuele_Pessagno,It's our victory. I'm really glad that I was able to be of help to you and the others.,1598
Emanuele_Pessagno,When I travel alone I keep all my emotions buried deep inside me But when I'm with somebody else I feel like I can open up my heart Ehehe I'm so glad that I get to share this journey with the person I love,1598
Emanuele_Pessagno,Th-thank you for coming all this way to see me Phew I've finally managed to calm down a little and I don't think I'm as nervous as before,1599
Emanuele_Pessagno,I have to stand up there in front of everyone as a part of the set Just thinking about it is making my heart pound like crazy,1599
Emanuele_Pessagno,If you're talking about my telescope I let my friends hold on to it. Y-you want to use it to look at me since you're sitting pretty far back? P-please stop teasing me,1600
Emanuele_Pessagno,Now that I think about it this outfit is pretty risqué I wonder why Laffey doesn't seem to mind at all,1600
Emanuele_Pessagno,Y-you shouldn't do something like that,1601
Emanuele_Pessagno,Th-the microphone isn't clipped on crooked right?,1601
Enterprise,You've come. If it's fighting I'm ready for it any time.,1602
Enterprise,So long as we live there are things that will never go our way. When we die it must happen in a way that carries no regrets.,1602
Enterprise,What is it? Sortie time?,1603
Enterprise,What the?!,1603
Enterprise,It's one battle after another huh,1604
Enterprise,I will show you what lies at the end of power,1604
Enterprise,Venture forth!,1605
Enterprise,I've lost after giving my all. I'm not regretting this,1605
Enterprise,It's over!,1606
Enterprise,Interesting!,1606
Enterprise,It is my wish to live honestly and sincerely. That's why I'll speak my mind if I have something to say. You too should do the same without holding back.,1607
Enterprise,What do you want to do after the war? --Me? I'll probably stick with you. I feel the safest out of battle when I'm with you. Will you take me along with you?,1607
Enterprise,Valentine's chocolate for you. I put my all into making it and I'm confident that no other girl's chocolate is better than it. Eat it. Promise me.,1608
Enterprise,It wouldn't be fair to keep you all to myself. As long as everyone else gets to feel happy I don't mind if you eat my chocolate later. Go on enjoy Valentine's Day – I'll hold the fort in the meanwhile You really want to patrol with me huh? Well alright. If that's what you want I'll oblige. Heehee.,1608
Enterprise,How how does it look? Do I look a bit strange no of course I like it. I'd say every girl dreams about this day just that,1609
Enterprise,As long as you are around no matter how tough a battle I endure or how great the pain I suffer from being separated from you I’ll go on with hope that I’ll finally be with you.,1609
Enterprise,Would you like to try my cooking tonight? Vestal said that I've already mastered her cooking skillsI am not that kind of girl who solely exists on the battlefield,1610
Enterprise,Because of you I started to believe that one day this war will past and people will smile happily again.,1610
Enterprise,Hmm I like you the same way that you like me.,1611
Enterprise,Be thankful for the past have dreams for the future and live life in the present!,1611
Enterprise,Merry Christmas! Is there anything you'd like as a present?,1612
Enterprise,Of course Santa Claus is real. Hmm? Right in front of you.,1612
Enterprise,A white Christmas how beautiful Eh? W-wait Vestal don't drag me back in! I'm not cold I swear I'm really not cold!,1613
Enterprise,Celebrate to your heart's content! These wonderful memories shall light your way during the darkest battles.,1613
Enterprise,So this is the traditional attire of the Dragon Empery? Hmm it fits quite well. Oh? Custom-made bow and arrows Interesting let's see how far these arrows can fly.,1614
Enterprise,My flight deck is also decorated with a theme from the Dragon Empery. Its colors represent joy and happiness. Not bad huh.,1614
Enterprise,According to legend a mythical beast called the Nian comes out during the Lunar New Year. It can be warded off by setting off a lot of firecrackers.,1615
Enterprise,I heard that it's customary in the Dragon Empery to hand out red envelopes during the New Year. Should I prepare some for the Union girls?,1615
Enterprise,Ah you're here. I'm ready to go whenever you are. Oh can't be forgetting my helmet!,1616
Enterprise,Vacation huh To be honest I've been deployed in so many places during my lengthy service that sometimes even vacations feel like yet another mission,1616
Enterprise,Recently Essex has picked up biking as well. It'd be great to go out with everyone else next time.,1617
Enterprise,Would you also like to see my trusty steed?,1617
Enterprise,Good work out there! Go ahead and take a break while the others are being inspected.,1618
Enterprise,Enterprise engage!,1618
Enterprise,For the sake of freedom and the Azur Lane I'll keep on winning!,1619
Enterprise,Sometimes there really is a no-win scenario,1619
Enterprise,Maybe I should just hit the road and never look back,1620
Enterprise,There is no doubt in my mind that I was born to fight. For the azure lanes of liberty Enterprise engaging!,1620
Enterprise,I do not believe that it is correct to wantonly resort to violence even in the name of justice.,1621
Enterprise,I'm quite impressed by the Royal Maids. Aside from their combat prowess they're also very good at a wide variety of other things.,1621
Enterprise,You wouldn't do this to Yorktown would you,1622
Enterprise,We still have missions that haven't been completed. You should check on their progress.,1622
Enterprise,Would you like to greet the commission fleet? It's a good idea to get some exercise. Otherwise Hornet's going to make fun of you.,1623
Enterprise,Enterprise sallying forth! Let us crush our enemies!,1623
Enterprise,Our slight advantage seems to have given us the victory here.,1624
Enterprise,So I've overstepped my limits?,1624
Enterprise,My ballgown? I don't normally get to wear clothes like these so it took me a while to change. Ah let's hurry to the venue. We shouldn't keep everyone else waiting.,1625
Enterprise,I'm Enterprise of the Eagle Union. Let's proceed to the event venue.,1625
Enterprise,Right I didn't get to ask you earlier since you were in a hurry but what do you think about my outfit? I value your input just as much as I value that of Hornet and the others.,1626
Enterprise,I'm used to emergency sorties. Even if I'm at a banquet just give me the order and I'll scramble my planes.,1626
Enterprise,What about Independence? Ahh she's a nice and adorable girl just like Eagle. Good friends who heal my heart from the weariness of battle.,1627
Enterprise,The girls in the commission fleet have returned? The formalities will have to wait then. I'll go welcome them back first.,1627
Enterprise,May this victory serve as the ornament to a fine celebration.,1628
Enterprise,Let's do our best today. I'll be cheering you on.,1628
Enterprise,Is that Zuikaku? That's a pretty showy outfit though I'm not exactly in a position to talk myself.,1629
Enterprise,Essex be careful when you're charging ahead! Oh um I didn't mean to patronize I just can't help but get a bit worried,1629
Enterprise,You'd like to help me with the maintenance? Sure. To be honest you might be better suited for this job. Ahaha~,1630
Enterprise,A photo op? Sure but what kind of pose should I make?,1630
Enterprise,The commission fleet has returned. Sorry but could you welcome them back in my place?,1631
Enterprise,Come spread your wings and fly!,1631
Enterprise,First place huh? Normally not much of a reason to celebrate but since we're at a race let's uncork the champagne.,1632
Enterprise,There you are. I'm good to go whenever you are.,1632
Enterprise,With so many museums and iconic buildings it's no wonder this city is called the Capital of Art. I'd love to come here again with you at some later point.,1633
Enterprise,I asked Vestal about places to visit and she suggested this village where lavenders bloom en masse. Said we should definitely check it out.,1633
Enterprise,After visiting all these places with you I've realized something – the sights themselves aren't super important to me what matters is seeing them together with someone dear to me.,1634
Enterprise,What's up? Our tickets are all in order if that's what you're wondering.,1634
Enterprise,Can we check out a gift shop now that you've claimed these rewards? I want to get something for my sisters that'll really make them smile.,1635
Enterprise,Commission team's come back. Let's go say hi and give them some souvenirs while we're at it.,1635
Enterprise,No matter where my foes appear I'll take them down all the same!,1636
Enterprise,Guess we're celebrating this victory with a full course dinner. I can't wait.,1636
Enterprise,This is why you never pop the champagne early,1637
Erebus,I am not the harbinger of death I am just.. guiding them after their times are u,1637
Erebus,Did you just have an out-of-body experience?,1638
Erebus,I'll always protect my little sisters.,1638
Erebus,I have to say this warmth I don't dislike it.,1639
Erebus,Allow me to channel forth the whispers of the dead,1639
Erebus,  uh  I'm sorry it seems like I was having an out-of-body experience.,1640
Erebus,You'll experience an eternity of restlessness if you die with incomplete missions.,1640
Erebus,Rewards are but worldly possessions. It makes no difference to me whether you collect them or not.,1641
Erebus,Letters are what connect humans. Hold them dear.,1641
Erebus,The silence after a battle is divine. Take your time and rest.,1642
Erebus,I'm not particularly interested in embarking on commissions The other girls always say I see weird stuff. I suppose it can't be helped Anyway your girls are back!,1642
Erebus,The purer the darkness the calmer my mind.,1643
Erebus,Please remain calm. The darkness will only make the stars shine brighter.,1643
Erebus,Allow me to harvest the souls of our enemies.,1644
Erebus,Even if you manage to defeat me you'll never escape the infinite darkness.,1644
Erebus,Want a taste of death?,1645
Erebus,The darkness is with us.,1645
Erebus,It was hard to take care of my sister at the beginning but I got used to it used to being alone? I'm just used to the fear of it.,1646
Erebus,Whenever I'm afraid all I have to do is think of my little sister. It gives me the strength to push on. Even though my sister can't be without me I can't be without her either.,1646
Erebus,I'm afraid no longer. Being next to you I'm willing to become the darkness to your light; And if that light were to swallow me No even if I was to be devoured that would be fine too.,1647
Erebus,Where there's light there's darkness. Wherever you are I'll be near. This isn't fate but the law of this world It's nothing it's just something that I've wanted to say for a long time if I ever found someone who I truly liked.,1647
Erebus,Be they living or dead shipgirl or human all beings long for the intoxicating warmth of Valentine's. Let us enjoy it together before the heat fades.,1648
Erebus,I put a little curse on this chocolate so that you won't disappear like Erebus did My wish is that you continue to remain by me and Terror.,1648
Erebus,Those who embrace the shadows will find only an illusory happiness But for me that much is sufficient.,1649
Erebus,I am still but a shadow. The only difference is I've found a small small thing to strive for.,1649
Erebus,I'm here as always.,1650
Erebus,No matter how long the night the dawn will come again,1650
Erebus,I am the witch of Hallow's Eve here to guide your soul into the ever darkness that's what the concept of the Halloween witch is about right?,1651
Erebus,The Halloween event has started. But I'm supposed to wait here until it's my time to come out.,1651
Erebus,Terror really wanted to go to the Halloween party with me but I,1652
Erebus,Legend has it that real monsters come out on Hallow's Eve Shall we search for them?,1652
Erebus,These festivities have diluted the ever darkness with noise and light but it's not such a bad thing.,1653
Erebus,T-trick or treat? Oh right you can have this special bewitched candy.,1653
Erebus,I can hear the wailing of souls passing through the ever darkness You want to know what they're saying?,1654
Essex,Everyone knows that the Essex class is strong but still Enterprise is all they ever talk about *sigh*,1654
Essex,There are a lot of ships in my class. As the nameship I have to do everything I can to be a good role model,1655
Essex,Musashi and Yamato? They were yes formidable rivals worthy of respect. I hope I can meet them again one day.,1655
Essex,Time to sortie?! Just leave it to me! Oh you just wanted to chat?,1656
Essex,Wh-what is this?! I I,1656
Essex,There are still unfinished missions? Mind letting me handle things this time?,1657
Essex,The mission rewards have arrived. Are you sure you don't need me to go get it?,1657
Essex,There's new mail for you. Here you go.,1658
Essex,The birth of the Essex-class would not have been possible without the hard work of the logistics teams. I have to show my gratitude to everyone.,1658
Essex,When will I be able to get jets,1659
Essex,All carrier-based aircraft in position anti-air defense preparations complete. All forces full speed ahead!,1659
Essex,Enterprise did you see my feat?,1660
Essex,I won't let it end like this I swear it!,1660
Essex,Spread your wings and soar!,1661
Essex,I wonder how Enterprise puts up with someone like you,1661
Essex,I witnessed the end of the era of battleships with my own eyes. Will carriers share the same fate some day?,1662
Essex,Jealousy? No that's not the case. Enterprise is a true hero worthy of all the respect she gets. However compared to her dazzling aura I'm just,1662
Essex,I might never be able to become a hero like Enterprise But when I'm with you I feel like I can do so much more than just that,1663
Essex,Even being able to see a small portion of these 2448 miles has been an eye-opening experience. Though I wasn't able to ride from sea to shining sea what an unforgettable journey it's been!,1663
Essex,Enterprise advised me to pursue some hobbies that aren't related to combat This should count as one of those.,1664
Essex,Combat is something that must be done at full throttle. It'd be dangerous to do that while riding though,1664
Essex,You followed us the entire way? What an incredible eagle!,1665
Essex,Phew Hm? This bottle of water is for me? Thank you very much! I'll help myself then.,1665
Essex,Did you want to rest for a bit? That's fine take your time.,1666
Essex,I even got Mr. Eagle here all decked out~ Looks pretty sharp and spiffy right?,1666
Essex,We've got new work? Um I really hope my head clears up soon Ugh everything's still spinning,1667
Essex,Did the mission rewards already get here? Th-thank god,1667
Essex,Everyone was greeting me one after another at the party and there I was basking in their attention so I started toasting everyone and Ugh! Why am I so childish?!,1668
Essex,The princess and the prince snuggled up to one another and sailed into the sea of stars above the castle~ Did you hear that?! Ah forget it Just write it off as me being drunk and let me cling to you already! Hehe ehehehe,1668
Essex,The Dragon Empery's attire and tools of calligraphy I see just wearing this outfit makes me feel more scholarly and artistic! I shall put forth my best effort to prepare for the port's Spring Festival!,1669
Essex,Happy Lunar New Year! I'll be waiting for your orders!,1669
Essex,One don't be blinded by the pursuit of perfection; two seek harmony in the spacing between ink and paper Hmm Does this look right? No there's something off still Man this is hard,1670
Essex,This is a special technique to maneuver the flight deck Fantastic! At this rate I'll catch up to Enterprise in no time!,1670
Essex,What are those girls doing Eh? Is that how big brushes normally are?!,1671
Essex,Intrepid see that star right there? That's Mercury but the Dragon Empery used to call it the Chenxing. Heheh~,1671
Essex,Am I supposed to add another stroke here? I understand. Um right here?,1672
Essex,The longer the transport distance the greater the logistical difficulty. I must extend my gratitude to everyone who works so hard to maintain our supply lines.,1672
Essex,Attack squadron ready to scramble! Just like an eagle soaring through the sky!,1673
Essex,I hope my eagle didn't get eaten But now's not the time to worry about that. Gotta focus on the investigation first!,1673
Essex,I am Detective-Carrier Essex unraveller of mysteries revealer of truths! Alright that's a good-enough catchphrase Gotta look cool in front of Intrepid and all.,1674
Essex,This piece of evidence is the drink Enterprise left behind? And there's a lemon here too? Oh uhh forget I said anything!,1674
Essex,This piece of evidence is the witness's photograph but I have to glue it back together – speaking of which where'd the glue go?,1675
Essex,This piece of evidence is The Manjuus that interrogated Cheshire seemed to mention something about an organization called the Republic of Essex How strange I'll have to look into this the next time I catch her.,1675
Essex,This piece of evidence is Wait isn't this Bunker Hill?! Why were you so fired up to get a shot like THIS?,1676
Essex,Let's let Shangri-La analyze the photographs. We're more cut out for field work!,1676
Essex,Y-you're trying to pass down the WHAT?,1677
Essex,I just picked up the mission rewards. What the heck is up with this Matryoshka doll? Pfft ahaha what a weird face~,1677
Essex,Don't let your guard down when toasting in celebration. Remember your limits and act accordingly,1678
Essex,The commission team is back! Jamaica sorry but I'm going to borrow your bike for a sec! I need to greet– err talk to the eyewitnesses!,1678
Essex,Open up! Detective-Carrier Essex is on the case!,1679
Essex,Don't assume someone's literally irrelevant just because of how they really look So that's what it means!,1679
Exeter,I can feel the honour of being in the Royal Navy no matter where I am!,1680
Exeter,York is talking nonsense yet again,1680
Exeter,My skirt gets wet all the time Should I change into something a bit more suitable for battle?,1681
Exeter,!! T-this kind of please don't As a member of the royal family if someone saw us like this,1681
Exeter,Please make sure to fulfill your duties - in the name of the Crown!,1682
Exeter,Honours and rewards have been delivered.,1682
Exeter,Exeter has returned to port! I will prepare the after-action reports right away!,1683
Exeter,For the honour of the royal family I shall not be humiliated!,1683
Exeter,I swear upon the honour of the Crown that I Exeter shall fulfill my duties and my destiny!,1684
Exeter,I am the successor of a long line of royals and shall embrace my destiny with countless victories to come!,1684
Exeter,Curses I shall have my revenge!,1685
Exeter,For the glory of the royal family!,1685
Exeter,May honour protect us!,1686
Exeter,Please do not bring shame upon the royal family.,1686
Exeter,What's important is the present. If there is such a thing as fate in this world I believe we were destined to meet.,1687
Exeter,Even though I said I had become more mature there are things that can't be changed overnight,1687
Exeter,My clothes won't hang down into the water now but don't you think this is a bit too revealing?,1688
Exeter,Sorry for the wait. Well then let us head to the party. I on behalf of the Royal Navy would like to give you a warm welcome.,1688
Exeter,York took a look at the roses earlier and went off about them being Bloody Roses or something. Just more of the usual huh?,1689
Exeter,I'd really like for my sister to stay silent around the others so as to not sully the glory and dignity of the Royal family but,1689
Exeter,The parties Her Highness hosts are always fantastic. Everything about them is just so perfect!,1690
Exeter,I can't stop worrying about the off chance that I'll spill some wine on this dress,1690
Exeter,Eek! I almost got some wine on the dress!,1691
Exeter,Aah! Don't surprise me like that! I ended up spilling some wine on my dress,1691
Fiji,Jamaica? Ah yeah proper oddball that girl~ But it's all good as long as she's having fun innit?,1692
Fiji,What's up? You look knackered Fancy a nap in my lap maybe?,1692
Fiji,If you wanna know my three sizes can't you just ask? I mean if you do I'll tell you~ Hahaha~,1693
Fiji,What're you staring into space for? Is that your way of saying I want a hug?,1693
Fiji,Commission team's come back. Don't forget to go greet them! Or else you'll hurt their feelings.,1694
Fiji,Battle time! Eyes ahead everyone!,1694
Fiji,Just doing my part on the battlefield really!,1695

Fiji,It's like back in Crete Sod that! I'm not letting that happen again!,1696
Fiji,All combat all makeup all the time that's me!,1696
Fiji,Oh yeah anyone in the fleet you fancy? Want me to assist you with them? Come on now don't get your knickers in a twist~ I can keep a secret~,1697
Fiji,Slow to catch on aren't you~ Right question! Could you believe there's a girl out there who's always talking about love with you isn't afraid to undress before your eyes and has grown quite fond of you?,1697
Fiji,Hey is my makeup looking decent? What about my outfit? Reckon I look as pretty as it gets? Good~ I've never dressed for this occasion before so I want to look as good as possible~,1698
Fiji,You want some chocolate from me? Naw that's so old-fashioned. Gotta get with the times. Let's spend Valentine's Day a bit more fashionably~,1698
Fiji,You like keeping up with trends yeah? Guess what – I managed to book us a table at a renowned chocolate store! During the peak season that is Valentine's Day no less! We're in for a treat you and I! Hehehe~,1699
Fiji,Sooo this year you're getting chocolate that's all the buzz online and your favourite chocolate from last Valentine's~ Nah nothing funky this time – I know what you like and I know this year's trends aren't your thing,1699
Fiji,Girls need to do a lot of preparation before going out you know? Hair makeup clothes you name it So if you want to see us at our cutest you've got to be patient~,1700
Fiji,Welcome back! Hmm how are we gonna celebrate your hard work? Ahaha what do you think about a candle-lit dinner?,1700
Fletcher,I can move quickly so I probably won't get hit. Well even if I do I'll probably be fine.,1701
Fletcher,Last time someone tried to impersonate me one of my little sisters told them to name EVERY Fletcher-class ship. That's when they gave up the act~,1701
Fletcher,When I look at my little sisters it makes me wonder Maybe our parents were rabbits?,1702
Fletcher,My little sisters would probably like doing this too. Huh? Your hand would get sore from it?,1702
Fletcher,I wonder if all my sisters can get an equal share of the rewards,1703
Fletcher,I'm back~ Wait huh? Did another one of my little sisters join the fleet while I was gone?,1703
Fletcher,A commission has been completed! Let's see what's next Wow there's so many! Almost one for each of my little sisters,1704
Fletcher,Now I can take better care of my sisters!,1704
Fletcher,There's only a handful of enemies. Let's beat them with sheer numbers!,1705
Fletcher,*Sob* You bullies My sisters will hurt you if they find out about this!,1705
Fletcher,My sisters give me strength!,1706
Fletcher,S-sorry I have to go check up on my little sisters,1706
Fletcher,Whew I need to take care of my sisters so much that I don't really have time to think about anything else,1707
Fletcher,Hm? You want to help me take care of my little sisters? There's a lot of them and I could use the help but Are you really REALLY sure? In that case Can I think about it for a bit first?,1707
Foch,It's important to keep your guard up while doing work. To put it as a strategist would This is not peace. It is an armistice for a long while.,1708
Foch,Maintaining a regular schedule is the key to efficiency so no pulling all-nighters okay?,1708
Foch,How to get along with Algérie? Well for starters she'll open up to you naturally if you have a cat with you.,1709
Foch,Is there something you're concerned about? Aha well if you don't mind opening up to me an extra head can't hurt.,1709
Foch,Eek?! Jeez I didn't know you were into this kind of thing.,1710
Foch,My hair's ruined now! Just kidding I'm not angry at all~,1710
Foch,We've gotten a new shipment of supplies. Are you going to check on them yourself?,1711

Foch,Victory can only be attained with the will to conquer! Foch heading out!,1712
Foch,How was that! The true power of the Foch class! Ahaha feel free to depend on me as much as you'd like~,1712
Foch,Even with these enhancements I'm still not strong enough,1713
Foch,You're not getting away! Main guns fire!,1713
Foch,There's nothing to fear! I'm still here!,1714
Foch,If you're truly planning on leading everyone to victory you'll need to put more heart into it instead of being this tepid.,1714
Foch,The knife-thrower who never misses Foch! at least I wish I were that skilled.,1715
Foch,Well of course I'm nervous but when I look at your face all of my worries just melt away~ Ahaha well I guess I'll reveal my true feelings to you Sure I'd love to,1715
Foch,Did I keep you waiting? Oops sorry! That's no good of me showing up late on our special date. I know there's no excuse for that but here take this as an apology. Yup you guessed right it's Valentine's chocolate!,1716
Foch,Algérie invited you to a cat café? Haha then let's go there after we're done with work.,1716
Foch,I'll help you out so you don't need to work extra hours.,1717
Foch,If someone wants to disturb the peace that we've built Well it's our job to stop them isn't it?,1717
Foch,If you want me to pamper you just say the word~,1718
Foch,I've gone and collected the mission rewards for you. This favor's on the house~,1718
Foch,Do you need some help with the reports? Leave them to me and go take a break. I'll find you if I need anything from you.,1719
Foch,Our supplies have arrived. Don't worry I've already checked up on them myself!,1719
Foch,Yep~ Feel free to keep relying on me~,1720
Foch,You're letting me plan out our date? What a mistake on my part I was hoping you would escort me to your heart's content,1720
Foch,Of course I like to dress up in pretty clothes. Did you never see me as a lady? Hmph. Ahaha don't be down on yourself I was just toying with you,1721
Foch,I had Algérie tell me what stores to go to so I'll lead the way! I guarantee that you'll have a good time as well!,1721
Foch,I've got one for self-defense. Hehe sorry about that! Guess you won't have a chance to look cool in front of me.,1722
Foch,Hmm What do you think about the scenery over here?,1722
Foch,Aren't you in too much of a rush?,1723
Foch,What are you planning on presenting me with as a reward?,1723
Forbin,Iron Blood or Royal Navy I don't care who it is I just want to learn more about them!,1724
Forbin,When will I become as strong and cool as the knights?,1724
Forbin,I don't want my life to end without having accomplished anything so this time I'll give it my all!,1725
Forbin,I didn't mean to draw my sword upon someone unarmed I am very sorry.,1725
Forbin,A letter? Wonder if someone's challenging you to a duel,1726
Forbin,Commission complete! Next time let me go as well. I swear I'll do better!,1726
Forbin,My odds of victory have improved!,1727
Forbin,All right! I'll surely be able to win in this condition!,1727
Forbin,I'm one step closer to becoming a knight!,1728
Forbin,I swear to take this defeat to heart!,1728
Forbin,How's this?,1729
Forbin,This fight's not decided yet!,1729
Forbin,If the knights found out that I had sworn fealty to a person like you I don't know if they'd blame me or pity me,1730
Forbin,There are all kinds of amazing people gathered here. There's just so much to learn Ahh I've gotta work even harder!,1730
Forbin,Why do I spend so much time training with the sword? Well it's true that I don't plan on using it during sorties but being able to keep myself sharp and in shape is surely an asset on the battlefield!,1731
Forbin,Looks like there are plenty of folks in the Sakura Empire who understand the way of the sword. I'd love to meet with them sometime.,1731
Forbin,I still fall short compared to the other knights but I'm in no rush. Slowly but surely I know I'll be able to catch up to them.,1732
Forbin,Hnn! Haah! Oh I started swinging my sword again without even realizing it,1732
Forbin,Hey there's nothing different about that place Are you doing this on purpose?!,1733
Forbin,In order to protect everything that we cherish!,1733
Forbin,At long last this wonderful day is here. It feels like I'm dreaming I'm so happy I just Forgive me I promised myself I wouldn't cry I Forbin the squire shall remain by your side for the rest of my life!,1734
Forbin,Just looking at all the flowers around the ceremony hall is filling my heart with bliss Ehehe~,1734
Forbin,I have a confession. Yesterday I was so nervous I started practicing my swordsmanship without realizing it Luckily my seniors stopped me right away,1735
Forbin,This bouquet symbolizes a knight's pride. Yes I've chosen to swear an oath of love and loyalty (*blushes*),1735
Forbin,You'd like me to change the way I address you? W-well um It it's too embarrassing after all!,1736
Forbin, Welcome back. Jeez the next time something like this happens you'd better promise to take me with you alright?,1736
Forbin,The commission fleet has returned. Of course I shall accompany you to welcome them back.,1737
Forbin,With this newly-formed bond I shall continue to forge ahead!,1737
Forbin,We don't usually get such fresh apples and tomatoes so how about a mixed juice? It's good for your health!,1738
Forbin,No more fighting no more wars That's the peace that we're fighting to reclaim.,1738
Forbin,I know the other knights went out of their way to pick this dress for me but I'm not used to all the frills and whatnot,1739
Forbin,Eep! N-next time I won't hold back!,1739
Forbin,I hope I don't get these clothes dirty,1740
Forbin,Even though I'm an Iris Libre squire I'm currently working hard to have a rich student life. Um maybe this is a bit too laid back?,1740
Forbin,I joined the Kendo Club. I'm thinking it'll be good to hone my swordsmanship skills against my peers and build up my streng— Huh? What do you mean it's a different kind of sword!?,1741
Forbin,Study is much like swordsmanship you have to take it seriously if you want to improve.,1741
Forbin,Oh some water to help me clear my head? Thank you very much! I'm so sorry for making you see that!,1742
Forbin,Miss Algérie looks like she knows how to hold her liquor But everyone in the Vichya Dominion seems like that except Le Mars I guess,1742
Forbin,Ugh How could this happen to a knight,1743
Forbin,A letter Um what kind of letter was it,1743
Forbin,The commission team has returned. I'll go greet them now Huh I'm not allowed to go right now?,1744
Forbin,You'll have to try harder than that to stop an Iris knight!,1744
Formidable,?!  Ah I was just doing a bit of tidying up. Please come right in.,1745
Formidable,Formidable shall not disappoint.,1745
Formidable,Ladies of the Royal Navy have many virtues but mercy to enemies is not one of them!,1746
Formidable,What a magnificent victory! Let us press the advantage.,1746
Formidable,Why you miserab- Ahem! You are truly worthy adversaries but next time victory will be mine!,1747
Formidable,The curtain falls.,1747
Formidable,You are all to redouble your efforts!,1748
Formidable,I'm afraid I've contracted a disease that gives me a dreadful headache when you're nearby. Would you mind going someplace else?,1748
Formidable,Truthfully even though I'm a Lady of the Royal Navy I sometimes want to have a bit of fun too. A side of me that I can't normally show except to people close to me like Illustrious Doesn't that make you want to get closer with me?,1749
Formidable,That Ajax she saw straight through me right away And yet I think we get along rather well. I've learned a lot from her.,1749
Formidable,Ding dong ding dong  incoming message from Formidable: Commission complete. Repeat. Commission complete.,1750
Formidable,A Lady of the Royal Navy exudes elegance even when wearing her swimsuit. Huh? Y-you're not seeing it? Really that's weird,1750
Formidable,Don't you find the atmosphere rather dreary? What if we put on some rock Er something a little more stimulating?,1751
Formidable,Hmm that would be Hood. Even in a swimsuit she's the picture of nobility. Of course that's nothing I'm not incapable of,1751
Formidable,Yes this will do wonderfully! Thank you ladies. Phew Getting dressed is so dreadfully time-consuming Ahem! How silly of me. I must not whine in the presence of others.,1752
Formidable,Ahem. I see you are as punctual as ever. Thank you for attending the party.,1752
Formidable,What do you think of my outfit? I was only able to wear it with the help of Dido and the others,1753
Formidable,Sirius made a few errors at the beginning but thanks to Dido they were finally able to get me changed safely,1753
Formidable,I wonder what kind of dresses my sisters will wear Ahem. I have no doubt that they will be splendrous indeed.,1754
Formidable,You'd like a dance? Very well Formidable shall be your partner.,1754
Formidable,Would you please describe how gorgeous my dress is? Yes and kindly don't stop until I feel I've heard enough ,1755
Formidable,Has my hair gotten entangled? How?! I'm always going to such lengths to prevent it! What if Sirius is trying to– Oh it's all right now? Th-thank you.,1755
Formidable,You'd like a dance? Certainly. Allow me to be your first and hopefully your favourite partner.,1756

Furutaka,Eh? I'm the MVP?,1820
Furutaka,We lost Too bad,1821
Furutaka,All right here I come!,1821
Furutaka,Kako acts like that because she holds herself as the role model for heavy cruisers but she's actually very gentle.,1822
Furutaka,I've never felt like this in my life before But as long as I'm with you I'll be able to feel this way more and more right? I can't wait!,1822
Furutaka,If Kako didn't help me with my chocolates they wouldn't turn out fine but now that she has they're not chocolates from me alone Mmm I guess you can think of them as chocolates from both of us.,1823
Furutaka,Well you said you wanted my handmade chocolate even if it isn't perfect so here. And please don't be too critical of it all right? Although if you have GOOD things to say lay them on me.,1823
Furutaka,Ouch! Ah I just bumped my head again,1824
Furutaka,My hair feels a bit messy maybe Kako can teach me how to tie it up.,1824
Furutaka,Since you like me so much I suppose it's okay~,1825

Fusou,Milord please rest your head here and allow me to clean your ears.,1829
Fusou,M-milord this is improper,1829

Fusou,Milord are you interested in the eight million gods of the Sakura Empire? It is fine if you aren't I shall offer them your share of prayers.,1836
Fusou,Milord you seem exhausted as of late. Too much work is bad for your health. Please come with me and allow me to purify you of your fatigue.,1836
Fusou,Kagura? That is a dance dedicated to the gods Ah why don't I perform just for you milord? I would be embarrassed if others found out so please keep it a secret between us all right?,1837
Fusou,Milord did you know that although a miko of the Sakura Empire must dedicate herself to the gods she is not actually forbidden from romance? As a matter of fact she is encouraged to find a husband in order to pass down traditions. Milord what do you think about me?,1837
Fusou,May our love last as long as the Great Pines in Takasago and the eternal Tsubaki. May we bring glory to our family our name heard across the land. These words are said with my highest respect. With this Milord you and I become one. Though I may be inexperienced let us care for and love each other for the rest of eternity.,1838
Fusou,I wish you a blessed Valentine's Day milord. It may just be a little thing I bought from the procurement department but I think this will please milord better will you accept this chocolate?,1838
Fusou,Are you fine with getting not chocolate but a Sakura Empire treat I made? Wonderful. Please wait here while I go get it then. In return you want chocolate later during the Star Festival? Ahaha as you wish.,1839
Fusou,Yamashiro and I made a lot of chocolate but to be honest I'm somewhat worried Oh this isn't chocolate? And it can be stored for a long time? And this one too? Hmm I don't understand western confections after all,1839
Fusou,This year I finally got around to researching chocolate. It seems they're even putting it in some of the Sakura Empire's treats these days So I decided to make chocolate yokan for you. Milord let's both venture to try new things this year.,1840
Fusou,Milord! Thank you~ Not just for the retrofit but for many many things. Hehe it was the greatest of fortune for me and Yamashiro to meet you.,1840
Fusou,Milord welcome back~ The profits show that today good things will happen~,1841
Fusou,I actually got a lot of things that I want to try such as be as lively as Yamashiro hmm is that too much?,1841
Fusou,Becoming more lively? Hehe that must be merrited by Milord.,1842
Fusou,I feel that bad luck still exists but being together with you Milord has washed away all my bad luck.,1842
Fusou,Yamashiro always tells me to look for my own happiness and I think I’ve finally found it~,1843
Fusou,Milord do you like the dignified Fusou or the livelier Fusou?,1843
Fusou,Milord can I also join you on this new mission?,1844
Fusou,Milord please wait I’ve made really delicious treats meant especially for you.,1844
Fusou,Oh no we can’t blame all failures on our curse.,1845
Fusou,Being able to wait for my beloved in this homely attire Milord my life has changed so much since meeting you. *giggles*,1845
Fusou,Being able to wait for my beloved in this homely attire Milord my life has changed so much since meeting you. *giggle*,1846
Fusou,Milord I just made some snacks. Would you like to try some?,1846
Fusou,Milord I feel my bad luck melting away when I am with you Thank you very much.,1847
Fusou,Ah oh no look at the time Milord time passes so quickly when I'm with you. I forgot that I was supposed to take Yamashiro shopping,1847
Fusou,Milord do you know how to play Hanafuda cards? Ah was it Souryuu who taught you how to play? Um in that case shall we play together?,1848
Fusou,Milord the freshly washed blankets sure smell nice. Surely they'll also be very comfortable to sleep on.,1848
Fusou,You'd like to take me out? Are you sure? Um in that case there are a lot of places I'd like to go with you. Ehehe~,1849
Fusou,M-Milord,1849
Fusou,Milord I believe it's time to complete your missions. I shall accompany you.,1850
Fusou,Milord I have brought the mail.,1850
Fusou,Milord the last battle must have been very strenuous yes? In that case please come lie down and rest for a while.,1851
Fusou,Milord I treasure the time I spend with you above all else.,1851
Fusou,Milord have you grown tired of me?,1852
Fusou,Dating is such an incredible word. Milord even though I've become accustomed to living with you my heart skips a beat every time I hear that word,1852
Fusou,Milord I have a small request but please promise not to laugh. I've always been jealous of the way Akashi jumps into your arms like a spoiled child but it's a bit embarrassing to ask so um,1853
Fusou,Milord being able to spend every day with you like this makes it almost feel like we're a married couple Ah um please forget I said anything!,1853
Galatea,I'm going to do this and that again today. Please take care of it~,1854
Galatea,Geez~ If you keep on looking at me like that I'll be reporting you to the authorities~,1854
Galatea,Hmm? Did you not hear that? There's no helping it. Lie down over here and let me check your ear,1855
Galatea,Yes let's see what today's missions are about~,1855
Galatea,Mail time~ I wonder what reward I'll get for bringing it to you~?,1856
Galatea,Aaaah cease your attacks! I'm on your side!,1856
Galatea,This too is fate~,1857
Galatea,Such disobedient kids~~ They must be punished~,1857
Galatea,You cannot escape from me! Be good and accept~ your~ punishment~,1858
Galatea,Hmph! I curse you to be destroyed by my allies!,1858
Galatea,This has nothing to do with my fate~,1859
Galatea,With this the bond of fate has been formed~ There's still a long way ahead of us so let's take care of each other darling~,1859
Galatea,My horoscope said that if I give you chocolate today our bond will grow deeper  Don't think you can escape my destiny~,1860
Galatea,You must be beat after walking for so long! Here have some hot chocolate! How'd I know? Because my horoscope said we'd meet right here right now and that a cup of hot chocolate would do you wonders! Clearly it was right,1860
Galatea,My horoscope said that you'll find happiness if you spend the day with me. And if we call it a date I will find happiness as well So if you want to make us both happy take me on a Valentine's date,1861
Gangut,Comrade what sort of strong enemy will we face today? I Gangut shall stand with you!,1861
Gangut,Know this comrade. Even if I am battered and bruised muddied by defeat I will rise each time to reclaim the glory of mankind! Yes that is the революция I desire the only heaven that exists for me!,1862
Gangut,Comrade how about a few drinks? What? Don't tell me you can't even handle a swig of vodka!,1862
Gangut,O comrade aren't those stories about the exploits of sailors absolutely riveting? You see that is the very spirit of revolution humanity in all its glory!,1863
Gangut,An easy victory? What a stupid thing to say comrade! How are you supposed to draw out your full power if you have nothing worthwhile to fight? Send me to a more dangerous battle next time!,1863
Gangut,What about my rigging? Isn't fully utilizing everything at your disposal a wonderful and pragmatic ideal? Why would I consign myself to weakness for the sake of showmanship?,1864
Gangut,What are you doing comrade? Are you not aware of how we handle lawbreakers in the Northern Parliament?,1864
Gangut,Missions exist for the sake of preserving the order. We should complete them as soon as possible.,1865
Gangut,Excellently done! This reward will help pave the next step of our revolution!,1865
Gangut,You have a letter comrade. It would be best to open it soon.,1866
Gangut,O comrade do you return bearing news of glorious victory? Ah but it matters not for the thing that matters most is that you fought with all your strength!,1866
Gangut,Hopefully our comrades will return bearing good news unlike that bitter Ice Cruise. Come on let's go welcome them back.,1867
Gangut,Comrades! You are also strong! Let our souls shine out brilliantly!,1867
Gangut,Show me your mettle!!,1868
Gangut,Rejoice for we have earned this privilege! May this celebration become the bread that sustains us until our next victory!,1868
Gangut,Comrade consider this not a defeat but rather a warning. A sign that we are losing sight of our revolutionary spirit.,1869
Gangut,The revolution blesses you!,1869
Gangut,Ahahahaha! At last this is a battlefield that I am meant for!,1870
Gangut,There is no future for those who mistake recklessness with courage comrade.,1870
Gangut,I am Battleship Gangut also known as Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya. However my name is less important the what I've achieved. Don't dwell too much on it and just call me what you want.,1871
Gangut,I hope you don't take this the wrong way comrade but this fight is not just for all of us. It's also yours. Never settle with the status quo and always seek to keep improving.,1871
Gangut,Ahahahaha! Well done comrade! No matter how strong the enemies we may face we now join each other courageously prepared to give everything in pursuit of greater challenges! What could be more revolutionary than that?,1872
Gangut,Let's get to the point! Comrade I was struck by your brilliance and thus I fell for you! And now I face the challenge of how to express my feelings for you! Here comrade accept my embrace!,1872
Gangut,A pledge huh? While this act is symbolic in nature it is also undeniable proof of the bonds we've formed. A toast comrade. Please continue to guide me in the future.,1873
Gangut,Hm Seems like it's Valentine's Day! Well Comrade it's that time of year again when desire and righteousness intertwine into a festival of chaos! Now it's time to face yourself and grow! Keep at it until you can devour every ship in the Port!,1873
Gangut,Haha! Comrade you kept me waiting for too long! Valentine's is a revolutionary day for all in the port. What better way to celebrate than to get plastered with your comrades? Let's drink my beloved vodka with a side of chocolate until the sun rises again!,1874
Gangut,Comrade~ have a bit more to drink~ That Marat can't keep up with me~ C'mon keep me company until dawn.,1874
Gangut,No strong enemies around? I feel your frustration comrade Well then come at me. Let's make life worth living!,1875
Gangut,I see I see so you want to fully grasp the extent of my rigging. Very well! I have no objections for your courage is commendable as well!,1875
Gangut,You are forgiven comrade! Such courage deserves to be rewarded! Come put your hands all over me until you've had your fill!,1876
Gangut,You have my thanks for this exercise comrade! I shall gladly carry out the important duty of judge jury and rehabilitator!,1876
Gangut,Comrade it is too soon to confess to your sins! Struggle for your freedom and resist until you are about to break! That is the true path to growth!,1877
Gangut,This outfit resembles something that you'd wear in the Eagle Union or Iron Blood right? If I chose something more imposing I'd scare off the kids!,1877
Gangut,This is Gangut Everything's fine over here so stay on patrol.,1878
Gangut,Care for a drink comrade? Come on it's good stuff. I just happen to have a little bit of free time.,1878
Gangut,Are you curious about this medal? You can make as many replicas as you'd like!,1879
Gangut,Having trouble with your missions? If you need to conduct an investigation I'll help you out.,1879
Gangut,Bwahaah! I've had all kinds of liquor but nothing beats the stuff back home! Comrade let's have a toast to the coming off-duty days!,1880
Gangut,I take it you've come to share a drink with me comrade? Ahahaha! What a coincidence I just received this bottle of vodka from Avrora. Two shots coming right up!,1880
Gangut,Have you read the article in this magazine comrade? It's a great piece on how the working class is the reason for our ever-improving quality of life.,1881
Gangut,Comrade you must always be ready to fight even in times of peace. If you get complacent with the status quo then who else will stand up in the event of a crisis?,1881
Gangut,The Sakura Empire is home to a few drinkers too I've learned. Ise and Hyuuga I think their names were? I'll invite them over the next time I'm enjoying some liquor!,1882
Gangut,Ugh! I've had enough of this! Get up comrade! We'll round up some more comrades and go for some target practice!,1882
Gangut,Drink comrade! Have another shot! You'll have to do much better than that to get me plastered!,1883
Gangut,You're drunk out of your mind aren't you comrade? No worries you may use the couch! Go on lie down!,1883
Gangut,My room is a total mess you say? I suppose it is yes. If I am to clean it the question becomes where do I start? The bottles? The magazines?,1884
Georgia,Oh perfect timing. I just finished warming up. Time to exercise? Or sortie?,1884
Georgia,It's a good idea to look over your weapons and keep it all working. You want to help?,1885
Georgia,I have a dream. A dream where the seas are free of the stink of gunpowder and all the people of the world live in peace.,1885
Georgia,If I had the chance I'd love to travel all around the world. The Sakura Empire the Dragon Empery the Royal Navy Hmm some kind of world tour sounds nice doesn't it?,1886
Georgia,GEORGIA BEEAAAAM!  Just playing around! Hahaha!,1886
Georgia,A mission? If it's a combat mission we're good to go. Hahaha!,1887
Georgia,Yo. Good work out there. Nothing like an ice cold Cola after work huh?,1887
Georgia,Commission team's back. Hey how about we serve them up some Oxy-cola? An officer has to reward her subordinates for a job well done you know.,1888
Georgia,You'll see how strong I am next time I fight.,1888
Georgia,Who am I up against this time? I hope they're up to the task!,1889
Georgia,No matter how thick the armor these guns can pierce it!,1889
Georgia,All we can do is fall back?,1890
Georgia,The sound of these massive guns is your funeral march!,1890
Georgia,Ack you scratched my armor?! You'll pay for that!,1891
Georgia,You are unworthy of my power,1891
Georgia,Sorties and battles really get my blood pumping but every once in a while it's nice to relax.,1892
Georgia,Why don't we go on a trip together next time? I think we'd have a lot of fun together.,1892
Georgia,So we head out from the Eagle Union Drop in on the Royal Navy and Iris then head over to the Dragon Empery Oh! I was just planning our world tour. Don't tell me you can't go?,1893
Georgia,Here some chocolates as a souvenir. While I wouldn't say these are luxurious it's good to try such foreign delicacies from time to time. Ah by the way these taste better when you eat them with some cola.,1893
Georgia,Oh you look like you have no idea what this is. Hahaha that's no surprise. After all this is specially-made Oxycola Chocolate. Is this Oxycola or is this chocolate? There's no way to tell without tasting it!,1894
Georgia,My dress? Oh Seattle helped me with it. We all know I couldn't get it looking like this myself,1894
Georgia,Seattle picked out this lace coverup for me. She's good with this kind of thing,1895
Georgia,What do you think of my sunglasses? I dig them personally. Hahaha!,1895
Georgia,We've still got some summer left so why not try to plan a Beach World Tour for us?,1896
Georgia,Ooh nice work on that sortie. Did you want an ice cream? I still have some here.,1896
Georgia,And just where are you escorting me today? I'm dying to find out.,1897
Georgia,The Sakura Empire's tea is good stuff! But I still feel like I want an Oxy-cola sometimes Huh? It wouldn't look right? I can't help it if I want one.,1897
Georgia,So this Momotarou pops out of a peach! What an amazing little guy!,1898
Georgia,Seattle I got an invite to this party or something. Any idea for a talent show? It has to be something better than the Georgia Beam!,1898
Georgia,Ready to be a proper escort?,1899
Georgia,Hey now you're going to mess up my outfit.,1899
Giulio_Cesare,You're right on time Naturally. I'll admit your timeliness is the one thing I could learn from.,1900
Giulio_Cesare,If you plan on toying around with me don't blame me when you get burned.,1900
Giulio_Cesare,You can honestly skip missions you'd rather not take on.,1901
Giulio_Cesare,On the topic of completing missions does it even affect the war situation?,1901
Giulio_Cesare,There's a letter for you. Assuming it's no private matter you don't mind if I open it do you?,1902
Giulio_Cesare,Triumphant once again yes? It's written all over your face.,1902
Giulio_Cesare,I've yet to hit my own limits!,1903
Giulio_Cesare,Am I out of my depth?!,1903
Giulio_Cesare,All shall bow before my might!,1904
Giulio_Cesare,You won't break my spirit so easily!,1904
Giulio_Cesare,Cavour always stresses the importance of courtesy and diplomatic discourse but I believe in simply speaking one's mind. Doesn't it sound dreadful to obsess over some idea of formality?,1905
Giulio_Cesare,A little bit of harsh discipline is the right medicine for slouches who can't obey orders. It's not that simple? Well I thought I was making a good suggestion,1905
Giulio_Cesare,A little bird told me you're free and I've got two tickets to the opera so what do you say? I'd say you're due for something you haven't experienced before.,1906
Giulio_Cesare,The romantic vacation I booked was all for nothing With who? With you shouldn't that be obvious?!  Just ask me next time? But I booked it just for you in the first place F-fine I will,1906
Giulio_Cesare,Have faith in your decisions. You are just.,1907
Giulio_Cesare,Valentine's traditions aside I can give you some chocolate-themed health and dietary advice. For example you can make a nutritious sports smoothie using chocolate and other ingredients. You should try some when I'm done.,1907
Giulio_Cesare,Save me your thoughts about how good I look in an apron – I'm only concerned with your opinion on the taste! Tell it to me straight: do you like my Valentine's chocolate? If you say no it understandably would hurt my feelings,1908
Giulio_Cesare,Cavour was saying this silly thing about giving more chocolate as your love grows. Don't you find that odd?! I mean I only have more chocolate for you this year because I happened to cook twice as much! Whether my love has grown or not isn't of any consequence right now!,1908
Giulio_Cesare,The treadmill is free right now. Do use it if you plan to work out.,1909
Giulio_Cesare,Want me to make a training plan for you?  Cesare's training methods send nutrients to your muscles and away from the brain? Did Cavour really say that?!,1909
Giulio_Cesare,Inaction saps the vigor of the mind Who said that again?,1910
Giulio_Cesare,Jogging courses fat-burning courses rolling hills courses Is it really this complicated? I'll just start with whichever seems the toughest.,1910
Giulio_Cesare,If you feel stressed out just let it all out on that sandbag over there. I can attest that it does wonders for the mood.,1911
Giulio_Cesare,What was that for?! Don't ignore me answer!,1911
Giulio_Cesare,Here take this! Don't forget to rehydrate.,1912
Giulio_Cesare,Tired already? For goodness' sake I thought you'd be more reliable than this. Don't go burning all your energy at once we still have a whole day of recreation ahead of us.,1912
Giulio_Cesare,Warspite's taking part in the beach volleyball tournament? You should've told me so sooner!,1913
Giulio_Cesare,Trento and Pola are out for you so you came here to lie low didn't you? No?,1913
Giulio_Cesare,I do like this bikini though it doesn't quite match up to Veneto's.,1914
Giulio_Cesare,Surely you know what consequences await you for doing that.,1914
Giulio_Cesare,Want some ice with your Sardegnian liqueur? It's best downed in one gulp when it's this cold.,1915
Giulio_Cesare,Are you charmed by my prowess in battle or just me? Haha~,1915
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,What are you standing there all stiff for? Make yourself comfortable. I'm not gonna punish you for it. You're not the type who fusses over a noble's manners are you?,1916
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,If what you're doing isn't hugely important just wing it. If you mess up someone will come and fix it.,1916
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Obbedisco! Just tell me what you need.,1917
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Well I'll be damned.,1917
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,We've got new missions. Time to do what you signed up for.,1918
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Mission complete Which is to say you've performed your duty as a dignitary.,1918
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,A letter? Open and see what it says.,1919
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Oh you're back. Go ahead and take a seat. What for? The after-action review obviously. Were you expecting something else?,1919
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Hey you completed a commission. You should remember that even if I forgot.,1920
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Pretty good. Nothing to complain about and much to love. Like my new firepower.,1920
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Let's get this done in a flash.,1921
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,I've won. My name is light cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi. Easy to remember right?,1921
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Hmph so you got us good this time. I'll be back.,1922
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Here's what I can REALLY do!,1922
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Knock it off!,1923
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,I'll follow your orders no problem but please don't demand more of me than that. It's just easier for us both that way. Besides you don't like being a slave to formality like Abruzzi do you?,1923
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Leading and protecting your friends is what's important not petty etiquette or manners. I've known that since day one. Heck I'm protecting you right now Well in my own way.,1924
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Can't you take it easy at least for today? You have all these supportive girls by your side – rely on them for once. Think of it like this: I'll never be able to fulfill my duty as a dignitary of protecting you if you're always working around the clock.,1924
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,I'm guessing you want me to look after you forever and ever? You got it. Simply always being there for you is a total breeze when you're Abruzzi's sister.,1925
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,You know the drill – we must again strive to spread Sardegna's glory. Heehee.,1925
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Not trying to throw any shade here but can you really handle standing up for so long? Stop fretting over appearances and have a seat. Alternatively go ahead and punish me for being too lax. Just kidding,1926
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,How about a Sardegnian signature drink on your afternoon break? It'll reinvigorate you I promise. Heehee.,1926
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Look you can honestly just wing it if the task's not important. Didn't I tell you someone will fix any errors you make? Mainly me your secretary.,1927
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Your bidding is my command and whatnot.,1927
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,No way you actually just touched me,1928
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Have a seat. I'll go get you a quick meal so take the chance to get comfy before it's time for the review.,1928
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Commission complete. Do you actually remember when you sent them out?,1929
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,You're all under my protection!,1929
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,It took getting through a storm to finally clock in eh?,1930
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Both the white and black swan are meant to be played by the same person right? Doesn't that make Roma and me rivals?,1930
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Da Vinci's the kind of girl who really gets into her role unlike me. Good for her if she enjoys it. Me I just can't do it.,1931
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Is Abruzzi watching me? Aw crap then I'll have to do hardcore practice or she'll chew me out. She should play a role herself if it's so damn important,1931
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Will you swear your love to me? Heehee~,1932
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,It's no big deal but something feels off about this,1932
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,You've got new missions. Wonder if one of them is like make a lovers' pact and you'll be rewarded or something?,1933
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,A dignitary never goes back on their promise. Mission complete.,1933
Giuseppe_Garibaldi,Watching me dance ballet is fine and all but I think it's time you do your after-action review. People are waiting you know.,1934

Glasgow,Morning to ye Master. Before we get to it today I was thinki– I mean hoping you would like some Valentine's chocolate I-if it's such a pain I could feed ye I suppose.,1947
Glasgow,Are ye really going to spend the day at the academy and not your office? Nah I'm not complaining or nothing of course not. I was just thinking that since it's Valentine's Day and there's nothing on your schedule today ye might be On second thought never mind! (What am I to do now? I left my chocolate on the desk!),1947
Glasgow,Your stomach can't fit anymore? Can't fault ye. When you're loved by everyone of course ye get lots of chocolates Sh-share it? Master are ye suggesting– Omph?! Goodness gracious,1948
Glasgow,Y-ye said ye wanted ta see me wear something different so But this is not cosplay or somesuch! I do actually go to school! D-do ye like it?,1948

Glorious,Ark Royal said that this day is one that both children and adults alike can enjoy. In other words it is a day where you can gather the little destroyers and make merry together right? It doesn't sound quite right to me but I would not mind being invited to the gathering as well. Oh th-that's fine with you?,1960
Glorious,When I put on this uniform my mood seems to lighten up compared to usual,1960

Glorious,The hot water is over here Oh the mail! Um I'm so sorry I could've sworn the mail was right there,1963
Glorious,I must gain a better grasp of the situation on the battlefield.,1964
Gloucester,Punctuality is not a virtue it is rather a duty. Master do bear that in mind.,1964
Gloucester,If you have the time to gape at working maids you have the time to do your own work. Master.,1965
Gloucester,More trouble from the Royal Maids today Belfast do look after this troop of clumsy louts.,1965
Gloucester,That Fiji is always buying cosmetics clothes and the like You must not learn from her Master. Life is to be lived in moderation.,1966
Gloucester,A maid has a maid's work the master has the master's. The maids serve the master while the master serves everyone. This is the way of the world.,1966
Gloucester,Do you need something of me? As your maid Master I will do what I can to satisfy your requests above and beyond our typical responsibilities.,1967
Gloucester,Take a seat over there. I am going to educate you on the proper way to treat a lady.,1967
Gloucester,You have as yet uncompleted tasks I will continue to remind you until all of your missions have been completed.,1968
Gloucester,You have uncollected mission rewards. If you would rather I collect them for you simply direct me to do so.,1968
Gloucester,Do check your mail If you would prefer I not remind you you need only check it sooner.,1969
Gloucester,Welcome home Master. Have some tea. Now then I must ask you were fully committed to your duties during the sortie yes?,1969
Gloucester,You should check on the commission team Master. Do consider how it may affect their assessment of you.,1970
Gloucester,Excellent choice. Now if you could also strengthen some of the other girls as well I'd be delighted.,1970
Gloucester,Please check your remaining ammunition stocks.,1971
Gloucester,This is but a trifling victory. Master should you be satisfied with such triviality I would find that rather troubling.,1971
Gloucester,I beg your pardon Master. I have failed you.,1972
Gloucester,All for our master.,1972
Gloucester,This is not going according to plan!,1973
Gloucester,I do not speak to things.,1973
Gloucester,Everyone makes mistakes. But I will use my experience to reduce the opportunities my master has to make such mistakes. Do be aware.,1974
Gloucester,Master you must keep a healthy balanced diet. If you find it troublesome I can cook your meals for you. Such is a maid's duty after all.,1974
Gloucester,Master you must be mindful of your comportment around women particularly the way you touch and handle them If you find this challenging I am willing to practice with you. Ahem now then,1975
Gloucester,Master we must improve your daily habits if we are to raise your work efficiency If you would like Master I could take care of- Rather I would be happy to stay with you.,1975
Gloucester,Master you need not resort to such methods to keep me by your side But if this is indeed your wish I Gloucester am happy to oblige!,1976
Gloucester,Preparing and delivering chocolate to Master is the role of a Maid as receiving chocolates is the role of a Master. I made sure to package and prepare as many chocolates as I could so I wouldn't fail to deliver some to you. Please confirm your receipt Master.,1976
Gloucester,Master if I may I'd like to lecture you on the etiquette for receiving chocolates. Not only is handling the chocolate carelessly rude it will only serve to hurt the feelings of the one giving the chocolate. Allow me to be your first practice partner.,1977
Gloucester,It is entirely for you to decide the time and place I'll give you my chocolate Master. Not only that – today I will follow your every last order without fault I-I must say I'm a little excited about that,1977
Gloucester,Master you are already the paragon of excellence for which I am extremely proud. But worry not Master in order to ensure that you are not at risk of making any mistakes please allow me to handle *all* your affairs.,1978
Gloucester,Gloucester light cruiser of the Royal Maids at your service for the Spring Festival You say I look displeased? I beg your pardon it's just Such holidays are in fact quite busy for the Maids. We have much on our minds. It is none of your concern.,1978
Gloucester,Master how is your work coming along? Let's avoid having you at the office for the holiday.,1979
Gloucester,The floor is filthy again? Oh those girls I told them a thousand times to wipe their dirty shoes before coming inside,1979
Gloucester,Master you should find a bit of time to spend with the girls. Don't forget those packets of New Year money.,1980
Gloucester,The Royal Maids are preparing tonight's banquet. As long as Belfast is there I don't think they will have any issues Actually I think I will go take a look after all,1980
Gloucester,Master it's impolite to stare at a lady maid or otherwise.,1981
Gloucester,We'll have to shackle the master until the end of the festival I'm afraid,1981
Gloucester,The port is all done up for the festival. But I get a headache when I think about having to put it back as it was,1982
Gneisenau,My duty is to support my big sister who is always charging too far ahead. Admittedly it gets a little irritating at times.,1982
Gneisenau,You mustn't put off until tomorrow what you can do today. Please take that to heart.,1983
Gneisenau,One forgets the cruelty of war after being at peace for too long. The opposite is true as well isn't it?,1983
Gneisenau,Looking back at it it's unbelievable that I would mistake that prideful princess as an old-fashioned knight.,1984
Gneisenau,Isn't it amazing how different people can come to different conclusions about the same topic?,1984
Gneisenau,A mission? Let me do some planning for you,1985
Gneisenau,Rewards distributed. Please accept them when you have a moment.,1985
Gneisenau,Welcome back. Please take it easy for a while.,1986
Gneisenau,A commission has been completed! Care to inspect the results?,1986
Gneisenau,It's fine as long as you haven't let power cloud your judgement,1987
Gneisenau,Truth only exists within the guns' range.,1987
Gneisenau,Sorry this is war. There's no room for mercy.,1988
Gneisenau,I let my guard down,1988
Gneisenau, Now you're in range!,1989
Gneisenau,All ships remember to stay alert!,1989
Gneisenau,Is it urgent? I prefer simple and effective forms of communication.,1990
Gneisenau,The present flies by like an arrow but the future always arrives too late. I hope that one day I will be able to see the future that you and I create.,1990
Gneisenau,A promise huh? Long ago I would have despised the notion of being tied down to emotions but it doesn't seem so bad now.,1991
Gneisenau,I've finished my chocolate sampling and studied all the available data on your emotions – and mine of course – in preparation for today. If there's one element missing it would have to be You think I've done enough? I beg to differ! I've not achieved perfection yet.,1991
Gneisenau,At first I was too embarrassed to wear something like this but I went along with it and after wearing it for a while I must say I'm starting to see things in a different light,1992
Gneisenau,If only my sister were here Now if we had some sort of pumpkin-smashing gunnery competition that would have gotten her attention.,1992
Gneisenau,This holiday certainly is well suited to us Ugly Sisters isn't it?,1993
Gneisenau,My tail? Oh it just came with the costume Still I'd prefer if you didn't touch it.,1993
Gneisenau,While I haven't prepared any candy I do have a treat for you to enjoy. Would you like to try? I'm afraid there may be some pain involved Hehehe,1994
Gneisenau,You say you see ghosts and goblins all around me?  I think you need a break. Getting into the Halloween spirit is all well and good but you can't overdo it.,1994
Graf_Zeppelin,The black goat's horn has already sounded. Quell your anxiety and wait at ease.,1995
Graf_Zeppelin,If gods truly exist in this world let us begin our slaughter with them.,1995
Graf_Zeppelin,I prefer the high ground because I can see everything everything that shall be destroyed,1996
Graf_Zeppelin,Easy come easy go Aren't things like that better off not existing in the first place?,1996
Graf_Zeppelin,Life is akin to playing cards with a stacked deck. Doesn't it make you want to smash the entire table?,1997
Graf_Zeppelin,I despise everything.,1997
Graf_Zeppelin,Quite brave aren't you? As expected of the one I chose.,1998
Graf_Zeppelin,Is the person who gave you this mission really who you want to fight for?,1998
Graf_Zeppelin,Rewards take them away.,1999
Graf_Zeppelin,Treasure the time you have to speak with your loved ones for that time is about to draw to an end.,1999
Graf_Zeppelin,All your fights all your struggles are nothing more than fodder for the End.,2000
Graf_Zeppelin,Ah so they have returned Just seeing those faces filled with joy,2000
Graf_Zeppelin,Ah if only strength alone was enough to determine everything.,2001
Graf_Zeppelin,Let us begin our symphony of destruction.,2001
Graf_Zeppelin,My enemies belong in their graves.,2002
Graf_Zeppelin,Next time I shall grant you despair even worse than death.,2002
Graf_Zeppelin,Die Funebre!,2003
Graf_Zeppelin,The smell of steel and blood,2003
Graf_Zeppelin,You again?,2004
Graf_Zeppelin,Ahh so sweet. Sweet things cannot last for long. The only thing that endures forever is ice-cold hatred.,2004
Graf_Zeppelin,Does prayer really work? Will God ever respond? Nein. Gods are called as such because they are merciless.,2005
Graf_Zeppelin,I have never been one to believe in fate but if meeting you was also predestined Hmm How ironic. For the gods to have given me the worst past but also the best future what purpose does my hatred then serve?,2005
Graf_Zeppelin,As long as you are here the world does not feel so insipid and detestable. Rest easy; even if the world was to become your enemy I would happily fight by your side. As a matter of fact I eagerly await this day.,2006
Graf_Zeppelin,Oh? Have you finally decided to make the entire world your enemy? What? You just want to be with me? Hmph very well. Eradicating everything that stands in our way doesn't sound bad either.,2006
Graf_Zeppelin,Though this custom of expressing your feelings with gifts is utterly insipid I suppose there is some entertainment to be derived. I prepared a unique gift for you so do enjoy it.,2007
Graf_Zeppelin,What you seek to do is neither destruction nor stagnations but the creation of a peaceful future. As a part of your plans I have no reason to deny you succor. Allow me to bear the weight of your responsibilities so that you may indulge yourself in the sweet illusion of happiness.,2007
Graf_Zeppelin,I absolutely despise Valentine's Day. Yes the brutal chaos hidden in the false pretense of peace and the forcible ways people push one's own agenda upon others. In much the same way I was also taken up by the atmosphere and was caught up in the making of a gift for you. .I'm very moved by your capability in being able to consider these clownish antics lovable.,2008
Graf_Zeppelin,Mock me if you must. For all my talk of loathing this world I came to embrace this peace to relish it. As I am now a heart fulfilled I can see that you may well be my opposite. Because you love this world so much that is why you seek to change it. Regardless all that matters now is that I spend each moment of my life with you.,2008
Graf_Zeppelin,In honor of this peace we enjoy I must pay respect to the future you're trying to create. This means I cannot simply loathe everything – rather I must make steps towards creation. However the path towards it proved far more precipitous than I imagined What I mean to say is well making chocolate is a difficult task.,2009
Graf_Zeppelin,So the Second Movement is a Lento of the summer and the sea? So be it Since we will arrive at the Finale eventually I suppose I can enjoy this moment of fleeting peace with you.,2009
Graf_Zeppelin,Didn't we agree to go to the beach? Where were you?,2010
Graf_Zeppelin,Now that I think about it other than forcing me to wear this skimpy bit of fabric what else is this summer season even for?,2010
Graf_Zeppelin,Is there a nice vantage point on the beach to sit at? There isn't? Oh well,2011
Graf_Zeppelin,I only wore this clothing because you told me to. If you didn't come to the beach with me I'd be rather upset.,2011
Graf_Zeppelin,Is it time to depart? Wait a moment these shoes are a bit hard to put on Come help me out for a second,2012
Gremyashchy,You've got lots of work to do. Like that huge stack of papers on your desk.,2012
Gremyashchy,What are you ogling me for? Are you some sort of creep?,2013
Gremyashchy,One whack with this thing dispatches any and all bugs and creeps. Mm that's all.,2013
Gremyashchy,Slacking on the job huh Maybe I'll tell Gromky about this.,2014

Gremyashchy,Thanks for making me stronger. Yeah that's all.,2018
Gremyashchy,I'm good on fuel. Only thing left to do is dispatch the enemy!,2019
Gremyashchy,That takes care of the enemies. I guess that's all.,2019
Gremyashchy,Ugh That was a pretty garbage battle,2020
Gremyashchy,Out of my way.,2020
Gremyashchy,I've been hurt. Mm that's all,2021
Gremyashchy,Why exactly are you still here?,2021
Gremyashchy,I've always got my eyes on you. Mm that's all.,2022
Gremyashchy,You might fool Gromky but you can't fool me. If I catch you doing anything questionable I won't hesitate to whack you with this thing. Mm that'll be all.,2022
Gremyashchy,You're awfully good at putting on faces. Unless you're actually an honest decent person after all? I guess I'll give you the benefit of the doubt for now. Mm that'll be all.,2023
Gremyashchy,All right you're a decent person I'll give you that. Huh? You want me to be with you forever? Ummmm I-I need to think about that's all,2023
Gremyashchy,Valentine's chocolate for you. Mm that's all. What is it weird to show my gratitude? Well I am and that's why I'm giving you it. Mm that's really all,2024
Gremyashchy,Need something? Yeah I remember that it's Valentine's. Here – you deserve it for all your hard work. I was gonna give you it after you finished everything else but you ran into me before that. Mm that's all.,2024
Gremyashchy,You've got all this work to do before the end of the day? I guess we just have to make a miracle happen,2025
Gremyashchy,What are you ogling me for? I don't see what you get out of this,2025
Gremyashchy,You always drink tea with me so why do you leave all the cookies to me? You'd rather I eat all I want? Huh I see,2026
Gremyashchy,Uhh woaaaahhhhh,2026
Gremyashchy,Are you ignoring all these missions hoping they'll go away? Yikes,2027
Gremyashchy,You've earned three cookies for today's sorties. Mm that'll be all. Now say aah.,2027
Gremyashchy,Next time do your job and command properly.,2028
Gremyashchy,Wh-who gave you the right to just barge in? I did? Huh. Well seeing as you're here I guess we could read a book together. Mm that's all.,2028
Gremyashchy,I got up to this part just the other day. Time to read the rest. Mm that's all.,2029
Gremyashchy,Gromky's looking for me? Ugh I don't wanna go outside. But I'd feel bad about telling her to buzz off and pretending to be sick would worry her Hrmmm,2029
Gremyashchy,If you wanna lounge around do it over there. Mm that's all.,2030
Gremyashchy,Mmmh *yaaaaawn* Huh?! Oh no don't tell me I dozed off You didn't see anything got it? I mean of course you didn't!,2030
Gremyashchy,Retivy I mean Tai Yuan and I shared our recommended book lists. It turns out we've got pretty similar tastes. Heheh.,2031
Gremyashchy,Want me to read aloud for you or?,2031
Gremyashchy,I-I knew it! You are a creep!,2032
Gremyashchy,You could fill a whole book with all these unfinished mission drafts,2032
Gremyashchy,There's a letter for you. Can I keep the stamp? Mm thanks.,2033
Gromky,Woah! Comrade you sure are early today! You know you can get a bit more rest if you'd like,2033
Gromky,Eh? What's wrong Comrade? Why are you staring at me like that Did I do something weird?,2034

Grozny,Those Four Unbreakables are a cool bunch. I wish I could join them but that's not possible 'cause that would ruin the naming convention. Very unfortunate.,2054
Grozny,I don't like foxes or invaders 'cause they both try to take my home from me. Once they show up you must drive them away.,2054
Grozny,кролик bites when it gets angry. Well not so much bite as slice I guess.,2055
Grozny,She who does not work neither shall she eat seems to be the rule here. With that in mind we should finish these missions now so we may drink tomorrow.,2055
Grozny,I much prefer the Northern Parliament's drinks!,2056
Grozny,I dunno what to say. Let's go with Ураааа!,2056
Grozny,Blahh I've had a few drinks too many,2057
Grozny,кролик грызть! (Sic' em Królik!),2057
Grozny,I haven't had enough to drink,2058
Grozny,Everyone tells me that is getting food from strange people is one thing but making strangers *into* food is not okay.,2058
Grozny,How does the milk cocoa taste? Do you like it? Then my handmade chocolate was a success Hm? Yeah I just mixed the chocolate in this cocoa.,2059
Grozny,Hold on a second. Humph Alright I welcome you to my abode The Manjuu looks nervous? Why's that?,2059
Grozny,Drinking from a can doesn't feel the same,2060
Grozny,The ball and chain? It doesn't weigh much. See? Oh sorry for startling you,2060
Grozny,I don't have my кролик so I'll have to use this ball and chain.,2061
Grozny,It's warm here compared to my motherland's waters. I can drink while wearing little clothing and still be fine. *glug glug*,2061
Grozny,Hmm If I tweak Królik around a bit like this But it'll probably be a problem if I don't finish this in one go Guess I'll think about it while I eat. Mhm.,2062
Grozny,Królik is taking the day off. It'll be stronger the next time you see it. Trust me.,2062
Grozny,Warm drinks are nice.,2063
Grozny,Laffey give me your rabbit ears for a second. Let's see how this looks Hmm It sort of fits but not really,2063
Grozny,Eat as many blini as you want.,2064
Grozny,Do you want to give Królik a swing?,2064
Grozny,Our shift starts now. Królik Pirožkí Manjuus – form up! Let us realize our Manjuu comrades' dreams!,2065
Grozny,Time to get to work Pirožkí. Roar!,2065
Grozny,Akashi made these Manjuu combat robots? Mwahahah. I guess even the bourgeois cat has her useful moments I appreciate the sponsorship.,2066
Grozny,Kent's scones are so good I'll take those as today's payment please.,2066
Grozny,Show me what you can do Porta-Królik.,2067
Grozny,Here Pirožkí. Food.,2067
Grozny,Don't tempt fate or you'll see Królik's bad side. Mwahahah,2068
Grozny,Avrora? Never mind – it's the commission team. They're back.,2068
Grozny,Time for action! Uraaaa!,2069
Grozny,I can keep this up a while longer.,2069
Grozny,Strong green tea is almost as good as hot chocolate. It sucks I can't chug it since this cup is so tiny.,2070
Grozny,Gremyashchy and I left our weapons at Gromky's place for safekeeping. She said it's dangerous to walk around with them out.,2070
Grozny,This fake plant looks nice Hm? It's not fake it's real?,2071
Grozny,*gulp gulp* Pfahh! Ahh I'm coming back to life Oh need to give myself a little splash Urgh now I spilled my borscht,2071
Grozny,*gulp gulp* Pfahh! The more I drink the hotter it gets Must be because I'm drinking HOT chocolate. Makes sense,2072
Grozny,I'm getting dizzy again,2072
Grozny,That's odd I haven't even cracked open the vodka,2073
Grozny,We'll take a cold bath after the mission? Okay. Be quick.,2073
Grozny,I hope Gromky's team comes back soon I'm going to melt soon,2074
Grozny,Khorosho. But now my drink has gone warm I can't drink this!,2074
Grozny,My whole world is spinning,2075
Haguro,Mornin'. Oh you're already here? Aren't you the real diligent type,2075
Haguro,Ya need me to tidy up around here? Sure thing. Then if you'd please leave the office for around fifteen minutes,2076
Haguro,*Yaaaaawn* I'm beat Having Myoukou lecture me first thing in the morning then having Ashigara fret over me Well of course I know it's for my sake but,2076
Haguro,Hmm? Ya heading out? Then I'll—what? You don't mind if I come with you right?,2077
Haguro,Here're your missions. I'm here focusing on the ones you've assigned me so good luck on yours.,2077

Haguro,So as long as you put something trendy on Don't mind me.,2080
Haguro,Give me a bit and I'll get to it!,2080
Haguro,Piece of cake. Not much else for me to say really.,2081
Haguro,See if you can spot me!,2081
Haguro,Who cares about miracles so long as I can protect my friends!,2082
Haguro,I'll take care of you right here right now. Just kidding I'd hate to lower everyone else's morale around here.,2082
Haguro,*Yaaaaawn* So tired Don't you feel tired at all? Don't force yourself too much or ya'll set a bad example for other girls who'd follow the lead and overwork themselves.,2083
Haguro,A-a pledge ring?! This has to be some kind of joke No way. I mean I'm perfectly fine with it but are you fine with me? I-I mean I'm a total night owl,2083
Haguro,What'll you be having me do today? Eh you don't have anything in mind? You just want me to sleep for once Is that my mission? Or are you trying to scold me like Myoukou? E-either way I know it's for my sake but,2084
Haguro,Whew everything's sparkling clean now. Tidying up the office always lifts my spirits. Same goes for you right?,2084
Haguro,It's surprisingly a lot of work being your bodyguard. Not only do I have to watch out for your safety but also for the other girls who try to N-never mind what I just said,2085
Haguro,Pfft hahaha No need to be nervous. I'm not the angry type like Myoukou.,2085
Haguro,You've still got some missions left. Plannin' on staying up late to finish 'em? Alright but I'll stay here with you 'til you call it a day.,2086
Haguro,Another win under your belt huh? Nah I'm not annoyed or anything it's just I'd like to prove my mettle on the battlefield instead of housesitting back here.,2086
Haguro,Commission completed. Now we need to welcome the girls back right? Yeah yeah. I know.,2087
Haguro,I'm the MVP this time around~! Whew who would've thought a proper night's sleep would make such a difference?,2087
Haguro,My skirt? Yeah I'm wearing a skirt today My skirt! S-stop don't look! Ugh what am I supposed to do about this now,2088
Haguro,Everyone's working together to clean up this pop-up café. It's designed specially to entertain you to the fullest so everyone's working diligently Perhaps too diligently since that's why I slipped and hurt my foot.,2088
Haguro,As our exemplar Mikasa really is so cool Compared to her I'm just a clumsy brat Ahaha,2089
Haguro,You want to treat my injury? T-thanks a lot *blush*,2089
Haguro,W-what are you planning on doing to me?,2090
Haguro,You alright? Not hurt anywhere are ya? Ehehe I was just thinking that we could slack off together if you had happened to injure your foot as well.,2090
Haguro,Commissions completed. What are you staring at me for let's go greet'em already. You don't need to worry about me I'll be fine. Jeez.,2091
Haguro,H-hey help me out! No I didn't come in here for fun. When I finished my security duty last night I got to thinking about how I was going to give you chocolate for Valentine's and fell asleep. When I woke up I was stuffed in this thing,2091
Haguro,If I move you're gonna see everything No I don't want you to see my bits! Mmrgh!,2092
Haguro,It's a little cramped in here but eh I'll be fine. Akashi should be here soon She'd lose money if nobody can play it right?,2092
Haguro,Yaaawn My bad. I'm a little sleepy This thing's ventilated so don't worry about me.,2093
Haguro,M-move the claw carefully okay? You'll crush the chocolate,2093
Haguro,Wh-why are you going straight for THAT place?!,2094
Hai_Chi,Do you have any interest in Dragon Empery's traditional opera? In that case I'd be glad to show you an example. What sort of piece would you want me to perform?,2094
Hai_Chi,My sister's pretty reserved but I don't shy away from speaking my mind. Comes as naturally to me as breathing!,2095
Hai_Chi,The Dragon Empery has a proverb that goes it is never too late for the noble to take revenge but personally I disagree! If you don't set wrongdoers straight right away they'll only be emboldened!,2095
Hai_Chi,Oh you are so gonna get an earful from my sister for this!,2096
Hai_Chi,You like my hair ornament? Thanks but no touching please.,2096
Hai_Chi,You've got new missions! I'll do the navigating!,2097
Hai_Chi,Mission complete! Might I interest you in a dramatic performance during breaktime?,2097
Hai_Chi,Those girls you sent out have returned! I've readied a small meal for them. An army can't march on an empty stomach you know!,2098
Hai_Chi,Spare no expense. Even a dull blade can shine bright right?,2098
Hai_Chi,Forward in formation! Let not a single scrap of armor remain of our enemies!,2099
Hai_Chi,When I take the reins none may stand before me!,2099
Hai_Chi,Bweh I'll get you for this!,2100
Hai_Chi,Hi-yah! We'll scatter you like petals in the current!,2100
Hai_Chi,Gah Don't you dare underestimate me!,2101

Hai_Chi,I wonder what gift I should buy for Hai Tien on my next trip Wait I've got it! The same as usual – a yummy snack!,2102
Hai_Chi,If I'll ever have to make a tough life decision I'll face it with solemn courage and thrust forward like a river current cleaving through land! .Hoo! Haah!,2102
Hai_Chi,We have a saying in the Dragon Empery the time spent sharpening your axe is made back multifold on the job. In other words taking some time to rest makes you more productive in the end! So with that in mind How about we go on a journey right now?,2103
Hai_Chi,If I've put you off with my habit to say whatever pops into my mind then sorry! Then again you've known me for so long you must be used to it by now. Right? Hehehe~,2103
Hai_Chi,Oh my gosh! Is this for me? Hehehe~ Know that you're in safe hands with me. I promise you're not gonna regret this decision! If you didn't know I'm the world's best housewife bar none! Now with our vows made let's get started packing our belongings and go on a productivity-boosting honeymoon!,2104
Hai_Chi,Reward the righteous and punish the wicked and you will live neither indebted nor in regret. That's my motto! You can't go easy on wrongdoers – they'll only keep pushing the boundary of what they can get away with!,2104
Hai_Chi,Being upfront about your feelings is good b-but I'd appreciate at least a little restraint!,2105
Hai_Chi,This act – known as the behind-back pipa – takes serious skill. You can't pull it off with half-baked effort!,2105
Hai_Chi,Allow me to play you a song on my pipa! Full disclosure though: I only started learning it a while ago. If something sounds off don't be afraid to point it out!,2106
Hai_Chi,Struggling with poetic rhymes? Ask my sis she can produce ten verses without even thinking about it! No seriously!,2106
Hai_Chi,You've fallen for my goddess-like looks haven't you~? Hehehe it's okay to come out and admit it~,2107
Hai_Chi,Clouds of fog sail the air as pond lotuses bloom. The mountain recluse descends from the sky to play a melody. My sis composed this little poem on the spur of the moment and I wrote it down!,2107
Hai_Tien,It is easier to relate with the despair of a wilting flower than the beauty of a blooming flower. Do you think I'm being too sentimental?,2108
Hai_Tien,What shall we do for dinner? Hmm How about some mapo tofu?,2108
Hai_Tien,Oh my apologies I was thinking about the book of poems I was reading earlier. What can I do for you?,2109
Hai_Tien,H-how shameless of you!,2109

Hai_Tien,Every word and letter written on this paper is a deep thought from far away,2111
Hai_Tien,It looks like the girls have returned from their commissions. Make sure you show them your gratitude.,2111
Hai_Tien,Is the only way to end war through more war?,2112
Hai_Tien,War stains the land for a thousand miles bullets salting the earth in its wake. When will the flames of war finally be snuffed out?,2112
Hai_Tien,I see Even horses can stumble.,2113
Hai_Tien,Even mountains will move before an unbreakable spirit!,2113
Hai_Tien,The fog's rolling in?!,2114
Hai_Tien,Please do not talk to me. I wish to be alone.,2114
Hai_Tien,Being able to find one's soulmate in the flowing river of time is the greatest blessing in life. Wait um that means we're more than just good friends. Err umm I'm okay with that too I mean wait give me a second to sort out my thoughts P-please just a moment!,2115
Hai_Tien,Western confections are rather fun to make. Unfortunately Hai Chi stopped me before I could put some of my personal touches on it Well here you go. And happy Valentine's Day~,2115
Hai_Tien,Whether you'd like to discuss some poetry or simply chat for a bit I'd love to spend some time with you.,2116
Hai_Tien,Ah um at least let me prepare myself,2116
Hai_Tien,Hmph I'm not a child anymore,2117
Hai_Tien,It would appear that the winds of fortune favor us today. Hehe~,2117
Hai_Tien,It is quite natural for me to be in high spirits. After all my beloved is by my side your warmth imbuing me with a happiness that overflows without cessation. What cause could I possibly have to be displeased? And just like me I hope that as long as I remain by your side your precious smile will never fade away~,2118
Hai_Tien,Just looking at all the carp in the pool full of vigor and vitality seems to uplift my spirit as well.,2118
Hai_Tien,I finished writing my couplet for the Lunar New Year and Ying Swei is preparing to transcribe it. She even said We made it through without relying on Chao Ho. Looks like the two get along well.,2119
Hai_Tien,I've prepared some splendid dishes for the upcoming Spring Festival banquet. Sweet and sour fish braised pork feet and dongpo pork Yep they all look good!,2119
Hai_Tien,You'll hold this for me? Why thank you very much.,2120
Hai_Tien,My it looks like this drunkard has set their sights on something other than alcohol.,2120
Hai_Tien,Lotus flowers blooming in a clear pond clouds flowing through the air a sage descends from their dwelling playing music and dancing about. Hehe Hai Chi's dance is something worth appreciating. If that sounds interesting to you why don't we go watch her together?,2121
Hakuryuu,So you've come. Color me surprised. I assumed you had overslept but that seems to not be the case.,2121
Hakuryuu,My room's a bit messy you say? So what? There's no problem as long as I can find everything I need.,2122
Hakuryuu,It is great to have access to such a wide variety of sparring opponents here Friends? Hmph just having one or two is sufficient.,2122
Hakuryuu,My katana is my soul. Should it leave my side I Never mind forget I said anything.,2123
Hakuryuu,I had the opportunity to roll some rice balls during my free time. You may have them if you're hungry.,2123
Hakuryuu,What is it? If you require something of me speak your mind.,2124
Hakuryuu,What are you trying to imitate me? Hey knock it off already!,2124
Hakuryuu,How dare you pat me without permission. Have you no fear of being cut down?,2125
Hakuryuu,Missions? I have no desire to waste my time on such trifling chores. I'll leave that to you.,2125
Hakuryuu,See I knew you had it in you. The ability to handle trifling chores is quite commendable.,2126
Hakuryuu,A new missive? Oh it's not a duel challenge. Boring.,2126
Hakuryuu,M-my katana Phew Ahh I really don't feel complete without it. Hey why are you still here? Do you really have the free time to stand around in a daze?,2127

Hakuryuu,Divine retribution befalls you!,2130
Hakuryuu,How could the great Hakuryuu be damaged?!,2130
Hakuryuu,Scum. Stay away from me.,2131
Hakuryuu,Praise me if I do well. Berate me if I do poorly. That's just how work goes. There's no need to concern yourself over me.,2131
Hakuryuu,Not too bad. You might actually be able to keep pace with me Hmph. But if you become complacent or regress I'll cast you aside faster than anyone else.,2132
Hakuryuu,Umm have you seen my katana? I swear I left it here but it's nowhere to be found Ahem! A-a-anyways if I don't find it soon um it's a really big deal so please help me!,2132
Hakuryuu,Now that you've seen my secret I can no longer afford to let you out of my sight! Hmph from now on we shall do everything together! Of course that includes going outside to play W-wait this kind of feels like I'm getting taken advantage of!,2133
Hakuryuu,You think I'd just sit there and listen to your sentimental M-my katana?! When'd you get your hands on that?! Give it back! Please I'll do anything you say! Fine I admit defeat Ughh but this somehow doesn't feel all that bad,2133
Hakuryuu,Huh? Valentine's chocolate? Heh don't you dare underestimate me. First I'll cut up this chocolate and drop it in boiling water Hmph! Haaah! W-w-wait don't put the kitchen knife away!!,2134
Hakuryuu,Oh it's you. What are we going to do today– G-give my katana back! Y-you're training me to get used to not having it? Whyyy?!,2134
Hakuryuu,If it's about that fight earlier we could've just slugged it out. What's the point of dragging the issue back to the dinner table? Ugh,2135

Hanazuki,I love the way countless flowers bloom vividly during the spring but even so I wouldn't want it to be spring all year long - that would be unfair to the flowers that only bloom in other seasons. Mhm I'm sure the four seasons exist so that all flowers have a chance to bloom. Hehe~,2199

Hanazuki,Niizuki is fun to talk to but why does she act that way when around people who aren't her relatives?,2205

Harbin,If you have time to burn wanna see one of my comedy skits? Hahaha I've got quite a few little hobbies outside of fightin'.,2212

Harbin,Looks like you've already made up your mind. But this venue isn't lively enough Let's find an auspicious day and invite all our friends over for a huge banquet. I'm gonna invite everyone so you better yell my name out to the world!,2219
Harbin,What? Chocolate? That stuff's great for replenishing energy in a bind. It's in our emergency rations isn't it? I wonder who came up with the idea of using Valentine's to exchange that stuff? Pretty smart I say. Hahaha!,2219
Harbin,I dropped by the Sardegnian dorms last time and color me surprised when they showed me to a massive outdoor bath! They even invited me to bathe with them Damn that was awesome~,2220
Harbin,If only you also had rigging like me I'd totally look forward to fighting alongside you. But since you're defenseless you've no choice but to stay behind me for protection! Ahaha!,2220
Harbin,Even a girl like me has her charms huh? Hahaha!,2221
Harbin,We've got another job coming up. Why not treat it as some light exercise? You'll get rusty if you sit at your desk all day.,2221
Harbin,Another job done. The two of us make an unstoppable duo. Let's keep up the pace and pick up the rewards as well.,2222

Harbin,I heard that a date is a great way for two people to learn more about each other. Well you choose the restaurant then and I'll cover the bill. Let's treat ourselves to some kick-ass food and liquor! That's not it? Did I misunderstand something? I thought that's what it said in one of those novels,2225
Harbin,It's cool. If you wanna look go right ahead! I got this swimsuit just because I wanted you to see me in it after all!,2225
Harbin,Are those the Four Unbreakables over there? Looks like they're buildin' a sand castle together How about we make one of our own?,2226
Harbin,They say if you hold french fries on the beach seagulls flock you. We brought french fries right? Wanna give it a try?!,2226
Harbin,Look I reserved this whole beach to be alone with you so that Huh? The other girls will see? Damn You've got it rough bud.,2227

Harbin,Look at you goin' for it out in the open Yikes.,2228
Harbin,Mission rewards huh? Aw damn they gave us frozen watermelon! Now there's a stroke of luck. I was just thinkin' of how to cool down!,2228
Harbin,Take a hot bath and you wanna stay in there a bit longer. Go in the ocean and you wanna start swimming. See what I mean? When people go places it changes the way they feel.,2229
Harbin,The commission team just got back. How about we invite them along? The more the merrier!,2229
Hardy,You seem to be running a little late. Your Excellent please begin your work soon.,2230
Hardy,Nothing can be achieved without repeated practice. Your Excellency you should know this quite well yes?,2230
Hardy,There's something relaxing about this office hmm W-woah?! I I'm not nodding off!,2231
Hardy,I may be a flotilla leader but that's because I've earned the trust of my sister ships. It's not like I have a higher rank than them.,2231

Hardy,Your Excellency I once more offer you a present this Valentine's Day. To focus excessively on superficial packaging would only cheapen the sincerity of these emotions Wait hold on that's not how you're supposed to open it!,2242

Haruna,"T-this feels a little odd From now on you'll be my most beloved H-how you ""compare to my big sisters""? T-that's not at all what I was talking about!",2252
Haruna,"(Haruna gave you a heart-shaped chocolate confectionery. She was intent on getting to you before anyone else did and expressed her feelings quite directly as she delivered it: ""J-just take it! Please!"")",2252
Haruna,I think it's fine to enjoy school life once in a while Hm? You wanna know what I'm listening to? Sure if you're okay with just one earbud.,2253

Harutsuki,Gods please watch over everyone this year,2269
Harutsuki,Do you like this outfit that much?,2270
Hatakaze,"Oh also did you know my original name was ""Destroyer No. 9""?  I suppose it's a good thing they decided to change it.",2270
Hatakaze,I think Matsukaze feels compelled to worry about us so much and sometimes we don't even know how we should respond,2271
Hatakaze,If you want to slack off all day just resign. Oh also you have much work left to do.,2271
Hatakaze,Anti-air is crucial. Oh also the price one pays for negligence is much higher than you think.,2272
Hatakaze, Now if you'd just use that bravery for something else my view of you might actually change.,2272
Hatakaze,Those with talent work a lot. Do not leave missions incomplete.,2273
Hatakaze,Well I wasn't expecting this big of a reward.,2273
Hatakaze,Check the new mail you received. Oh also I have a copy of it as well.,2274
Hatakaze,Admirable work out there. Have some tea and reflect on your tactics.,2274
Hatakaze,Before you go collect those mission rewards remember to give thanks to those who worked so hard for them.,2275
Hatakaze,You needn't go so far for the likes of me But I'm still grateful.,2275
Hatakaze,Don't think too hard just do your part and we'll win. Let's go!,2276
Hatakaze,A victory is merely a victory. Garishness and applause are needless.,2276
Hatakaze,It seems I have not kept up with the times,2277
Hatakaze,It seems to be my turn.,2277
Hatakaze,Agh So this is why they say you can't flee from pain,2278
Hatakaze,Could you acknowledge the error of your ways before other girls start thinking poorly of you?,2278
Hatakaze,If you'd like perhaps I could give you a wise lady's advice on how to interact with others?,2279
Hatakaze,Different people must be treated in their own unique way. This is no secret to social success but it will help make you more sociable.,2279
Hatakaze,Ah you should also take this amulet. It will make you more sociable. But beware: if you use it to hurt someone you will be too.,2280
Hatakaze,If something's on your mind tell me. I may be old but my experience has been useful for solving many problems. Besides why would you hide anything from your partner? Ahah.,2280
Hatakaze,It's me you want? But I'm not attractive I'm just a bother who likes nagging about you You're really not joking? I-if so *Ahem* then till the oceans of the world dry up I will remain by your side.,2281
Hatakaze,You should treasure chocolate received from a girl. Oh also that means treasuring the feelings behind the chocolate more so than the chocolate itself. So in short be appreciative of this chocolate I'm giving you now.,2281
Hatakaze,Don't worry about it. It's normal not to get any chocolate on Valentine's Day. But since you have me you'll get at least one. How about it? Aren't you going to thank me?,2282
Hatakaze,I see you took my advice and sook refuge in your room from all those predatory girls. That's what I like to see. Oh also I've confiscated all the chocolate those girls were going to give you I'm joking of course. Just forget about everything else and take this moment to rest. Hah.,2282
Hatakaze,I see you boldly waiting out in the open without fear. That is proof of your growth. It's understandable to be wary of the wilder girls but hiding from them will only put off the problem. Oh also I've made chocolate for you. Allow me to give it to you another time; inviting the jealousy of others would only cause trouble for you.,2283
Hazelwood,Right on time~! I just finished warming up~ Let's get going!,2283
Hazelwood,Phew! That feels great! The warm sunshine feels amazing today!,2284

Hazelwood,There are lots of girls here who like to run fast. That's why I'd like to race them!,2291
Hazelwood,The sun isn't coming out today But no matter hehe! As long as I stick with you I won't get mopey at all~!,2291
Hazelwood,Want to eat Valentine's Day chocolate together? Great! I was thinking there's no way you'd be able to finish all that by yourself right? I can get all my sisters to help out as well~,2292
Hazelwood,"Bush was like ""I'll help you out if you wanna try making it yourself."" But you want chocolate made by people who know their stuff right? So instead I got some and put my effort into making the wrapping look really cute!",2292
Helena,I can't rely on this thing alone,2293
Helena,If only my guns could be as strong as my radar,2293
Helena,Hm? I'm fine. I'm just a little distracted.,2294

Helena,I think I've been more at ease lately No I was just too tense up until now. It's all thanks to the courage you've given me by being beside me.,2300
Helena,Thanks for telling me your preferences last year. I decided to put the knowledge to use and I invited St. Louis to make chocolate with me. Oh and don't worry our chocolates won't taste identical – we based our recipes on different aspects you like. Hehe~ Hope you enjoy.,2301
Helena,This year's Valentine's was a break from the norm. I didn't consult anyone I just thought of you and what you like while I made this chocolate. How sweet would you like it? How should it smell? How strong should the cocoa be? How easily should it melt in the mouth? Things like that. And I loved every moment of it.,2301
Helena,"St. Louis always praises me like ""my how you've grown"" whenever I do anything It's kind of embarrassing",2302
Helena,You want to know what my new and improved SG is capable of? All right Find a place to hide that nobody knows about. Hehehe~,2302
Helena,I think everyone would be better off living in the present without regrets than spend every day anxious about the future.,2303
Helena,It's not enough to focus only on improving my equipment. I need to become stronger to use it properly too.,2303
Helena,SG receiving message A commission team has returned to port.,2304
Helena,I'm going to win!,2304
Helena,Don't get complacent Helena You've got to get even stronger!,2305
Helena,It's okay Helena. There's always next time!,2305
Helena,I used to feel constant anxiety over if I'm capable or not but nowadays that anxiety's been overtaken by confidence knowing all will be fine when you're with me. Heehee.,2306
Helena,I'll cook dinner tonight! And breakfast tomorrow and dinner after that and breakfast the day after– Oops! I blurted all that without thinking,2306
Helena,Having experienced such bliss for a while now I've started wishing for an even more blissful future It's sort of selfish of me but you don't mind do you?,2307
Helena,I can't be reliant on my SG forever Huh? So I should turn to you for help instead? Okay! I'll try to at least,2307
Helena,I should be fine if you um hold my hand for just another minute,2308
Helena,W-wait I need time to prepare myself,2308
Helena,The commission team has come back. That's at least some weight off my mind.,2309
Helena,I want to be part of the new year festivities too. Oh you don't have to worry about me. I'm no longer the fledgling I once was.,2309
Helena,It seems the New Year's spirit has swept over the entire fleet.,2310
Helena,My New Year's wish is that I'll be more courageous and positive and that no harm will come to any of my friends,2310
Helena,For this year's shrine visit the whole Brooklyn-class Cleveland and her Knights of The Sea all went there together as one big family.,2311
Helena,It's snowing I never realized how peaceful and beautiful snow can be.,2311
Helena,Huh? I was just thinking about what I should do during New Year's There are so many things I want to do.,2312
Helena,I want to win!,2312
Helena,That's right! You did a great job me!,2313
Helena,It's okay there's always the next time!,2313
Helena,"In preparation for today I got St. Louis to teach me how to dance. She laughed a lot at me telling me I'm ""such a klutz"" Ahah.",2314
Helena,I'm not going to be scared or hesitate ever again because you and my friends are always with me.,2314
Helena,Yeah that's right! You're awesome Helena!,2315
Helena,It's okay there's always next time!,2315
Helena,You and my friends have always taken care of looked after and protected me. But that can't go on forever. I want to stand beside you and become someone people can count on So could you wait for me just a little longer please?,2316
Hermes,You're back. Now it's time to duel!,2316
Hermes,Statistics aren't important it's how you take advantage of them.,2317
Hermes,It's my turn! Victory aside I also want to bring happiness to everyone.,2317

Hermes,Your spirit is a great weapon and an even greater weakness. No matter where you are you must not forget that.,2323
Hermes,Centaur taught me how to make this. Try it. I'm showing you that I'm more than just a duelist.,2324
Hermes,There is something present in the mail beyond what you can see with your eyes. That is: friendship.,2324
Hermes,Hangar gate open!,2325
Hermes,Hatred no matter how deep it runs will always be weak.,2325
Hermes,My path to victory does not end here!,2326
Hermione,I really admire the head of the Royal Maid Miss Belfast She can do anything and has a strong will to boot I hope I can become like her one day.,2326
Hermione,It's not good to strain yourself by overworking. How about splashing some water on your face to refresh yourself?,2327
Hermione,A fizzy drink? What am I going to do with you? I suppose you can have just one bottle all right?,2327
Hermione,My have I gotten stronger?,2328
Hermione,The enemy's been detected~,2328
Hermione,Oh my what a failure,2329
Hermione,I hope this hits~,2329
Hermione,It seems I let my guard down,2330
Hermione,Every Valentine's Day I'm torn between the desire of letting you eat delectable chocolate and the desire of keeping you in good health But I believe I've found a solution that strikes a fair balance between the two: you could drink decaf herbal tea to go with your chocolate. I'll make sure to pick some herbs that complement the taste well!,2330
Hermione,Does it look like I went all-out on this one? You know I've put a lot of thought into how you can accept everyone's chocolate while still staying healthy. Allow me to put my ideas into practice for you while you enjoy this special day!,2331
Hermione,This feeling of doing work with you by your side It feels really great. Yep~,2331
Hermione,A fizzy drink? I guess it can't be helped. Just one more alright?,2332
Hermione,Good grief you never change,2332
Hermione,Are we playing doctor?,2333
Hermione,Actually I bought this swimsuit back when it was on sale. I'm relieved that you like it,2333
Hermione,Overexposure to the sun isn't good for your skin. Why don't we move somewhere else in a little bit?,2334
Hermione,A nap? Y-yes! Please take your time and relax to your heart's content. If something happens hm don't worry I'll make sure you wake up when that happens.,2334
Hermione,I've prepared a cool refreshing drink for you. Please enjoy.,2335
Hermione,I changed into slightly more formal attire in preparation for us having afternoon tea together. Do you think it doesn't suit me well?,2335
Hermione,"The first thing that comes to mind when one speaks of ""elegance"" must surely be Miss Illustrious or Miss Hood. Oh you'd include me as well? Hehe I'm honoured~",2336
Hermione,Hm? You'd like another serving of tea? Sure here you go~ Please let me know if there's anything you want~,2336
Hermione,Before you continue with your work please enjoy a delicious slice of cake and unwind a little~,2337
Hermione,My fellow Royal Maids drew inspiration from the Dragon Empery's traditional attire when crafting these clothes. I do hope you like them.,2337
Hermione,It is often said that the best medicine is bitter but I tried to make mine as sweet as possible to suit your tastes.,2338
Hermione,I wonder what kinds of effects these herbs have I should ask Dido later.,2338
Hermione,I am quite proficient at following recipes and preparing ingredients. They're skills I often use as part of my work with the Royal Maids.,2339

Hibiki,Awww Looks like I'll have to go back to port for repairs,2347
Hibiki,Trust in me!,2347
Hibiki,I won't let it end like this!,2348
Hibiki,I've been making Akatsuki worried all this time. I have to apologize to her properly as well as thank her.,2348
Hibiki,Akatsuki you've been pretty gung-ho about getting the 6th DesDiv back together Well the name's not that important as long as we're all together. That's what I think anyway~,2349
Hibiki,"This is the chocolate I made with Akatsuki and the others! Oh I had so much fun making it with everyone! I think Akatsuki felt the same way! Even though I'm sure she'll say something like ""I swear I haven't been seduced by the confectionary arts."" ",2349
Hibiki,I present you with Hibiki's Valentine's chocolate jam-packed with love and emotion! Feast your eyes and prepare your palate for this deluxe delicacy made by yours truly!,2350
Hibiki,Well um y'see sorry to keep you all waiting for so long. I do feel kinda bad about it but since we're all here let's cheer up and put the past behind us! That's right look forward! Ehehe~!,2350
Hibiki,Akatsuki you went all the way to the South Pole to look for me?! W-well I certainly didn't expect that,2351
Hibiki,Just like me Fubuki seems to also like being the center of attention. But for whatever reason only she keeps getting herself into weird situations. Why is that?,2351
Hibiki,This brisk weather is nothing compared to the cold of the Northern Parliament! Huh? I'm comparing it to the wrong thing?,2352
Hibiki,Want to know more about oni horn? Or this golden badge here?,2352
Hibiki,Good work~ Even though it's the New Year's season there's still a mountain of work to get through isn't there~? Looks like I won't get to sleep the day away after all *sniff*~,2353
Hiei,Hehe~ Which do you prefer: matcha or black tea?,2353
Hiei,*Sigh* Whenever Kirishima comes to a banquet all those kids that tag along with her usually end up making a mess of things,2354
Hiei,When it comes to warfare wisdom and courage are equally important. We can't count on another miracle if we discard proper planning and rely on blind courage.,2354
Hiei,I can take you anywhere the ocean reaches.,2355
Hiei,Let's finish while we still have the momentum!,2355
Hiei,Hehe shall we celebrate by holding a banquet tonight?,2356
Hiei,Are all of these new letters? Thank you for your hard work.,2356
Hiei,Welcome back. The tea has just been brewed to the right temperature.,2357
Hiei,Welcome back everyone. Hopefully none of you encountered any suspicious people?,2357
Hiei,Today's breeze feels more pleasant than usual.,2358
Hiei,Hehe shall we go enjoy the festivities?,2358
Hiei,It was no big deal~,2359
Hiei,Was I bested?,2359
Hiei,Be swept away by the raging waves!,2360
Hiei,What a pity,2360
Hiei,That Kirishima She's actually quite the popular one,2361
Hiei,Being able to see everyone's smiles at the banquet makes all the hard work and preparation worth it.,2361
Hiei,"So this means ""We'll always be forever?"" Thank you very much. I'll gladly accept it - however If anything was to happen to us I hope that you would consider yourself first",2362
Hiei,Which pillow would you prefer? The soft one the hard one or perhaps you'd like to use my thighs? Hehe~,2362
Hiei,I never expected this Spring Banquet to take on a life of its own By the looks of things everyone prefers it when the atmosphere is a bit livelier. Hehe~,2363
Hiei,You'd like a red envelope as well? Normally aren't you supposed to be giving out red envelopes to us? Heehee~,2363
Hiei,During these times it's best to just put aside your work and enjoy the festivities.,2364
Hiei,Sake? Hehe since it's a special occasion I wouldn't mind sharing a cup with you~,2364
Hiei,We're headed for the white sands of the beach today. We all could use a breather every now and then so let's just enjoy the sea breeze today. Hehe~,2365
Hiei,Did my sand castle capture your interest? This was only possible because of the clement weather after all~,2365
Hiei,A seaside picnic might not be as lavish as the banquets I usually hold but I am confident in my abilities to throw the best event possible~ Hehe don't worry some girls from the Eagle Union are helping me out.,2366
Hiei,The seagulls are flying into the distance. I wonder if they're splitting apart or reuniting Hehe~,2366
Hiei,Have you been enjoying your time here? Hehe~ If you get thirsty please help yourself to this water.,2367
Hiryuu,Isn’t this pose super cool?,2367
Hiryuu,All systems go! Ready to sortie at any time.,2368
Hiryuu,Be careful. You might get hurt if you get too close!,2368
Hiryuu,A mission huh? I’m looking forward to any kind of challenge.,2369
Hiryuu,Mail! Eh it’s dangerous to throw them around like airplanes? Fine,2369
Hiryuu,Here are the combat logs. Let's start reviewing the battle..,2370
Hiryuu,Hey! I’m in pretty great shape!,2370
Hiryuu,Victory goes the one who strikes first! Planes take off!,2371
Hiryuu,Don't be afraid of gunfire!,2371
Hiryuu,Haa! (Her fist stops next to your face) Stay away from me.,2372
Hiryuu,Since I am always thinking about combat the other girls keep saying that I’m not feminine at all. So um that’s what I’m trying to improve here.,2372
Hiryuu,About acting more feminine do you think Souryuu is more attractive because of her cold demeanor? Oh and her ankles are amazing. It would be great if I could become like her.,2373
Hiryuu,I’m neither gentle like the other girls nor attractive like my sister. The only thing I’m confident about is my combat prowess. Would you still be willing to accept a girl like me?,2373
Hiryuu,Retrofit complete! Aircraft Carrier Hiryuu reporting for duty! Hahaha! I finally got the chance to use that line! I'll be counting on you once more!,2374
Hiryuu,I want to become as calm and collected as Souryuu but it's no easy feat,2374
Hiryuu,Ugh I have to slowly get used to your behavior patterns,2375
Hiryuu,Good work out there. As usual I'll start working on the combat report.,2375
Hiryuu,The disciplinary committee wouldn't exist if there weren't bad chicks like me! C'mon let's totally own this school before my sister catches us!,2376
Hiryuu,There's a fairy hiding in the library you say? If she's confined to the library all the time do you think she's being bullied?!,2376
Hiryuu,I'm supposed to be a bully but how exactly do you do that?,2377
Hiryuu,Playing hooky? I don't think it's right to abandon your duties as a student. F-fighting? Picking on others is even worse!,2377
Hiryuu,How am I supposed to become the bad girl counterpart to rival my sister? I just don't get it,2378
Hiryuu,My club looks pretty scary right?,2378
Hiryuu,I won't be able to face all the girls who look up to me if we don't go greet the commission fleet This school bully will make an exception and welcome the girls back!,2379
Hiyou,You gonna ask if I wanna go for lunch?,2379
Hiyou,Ah Izumo I'd like to meet her one day.,2380
Hiyou,I'm slow-witted? Hmph believe it or not I'm a girl with a lot on her mind.,2380
Hiyou,D-didn't I tell you I was lightly armored?!,2381
Hiyou,If we keep earning honors one day even I can become a full-fledged carrier!,2381
Hiyou,Doesn't matter if it's a pigeon or a plane delivering your mail does it?,2382
Hiyou,Planes up on deck It's time we all get ready.,2382
Hiyou,I was actually designed with these types of missions in mind,2383
Hiyou, Seems my technique's gotten more refined.,2383
Hiyou,In the name of the wings of the sky: take off!,2384
Hiyou,It was all thanks to my little planes.,2384
Hiyou,It's pretty hard to ignore the damage done to my planes,2385
Hiyou,Planes take off!,2385
Hiyou,So filthy What? I'm not talking about you,2386
Hiyou,Junyou is I know I'm warning you about my own little sister but she's really dangerous,2386
Hiyou,My eyepatch? Kinda just started wearing it on a whim. Plenty of people out there who dress like pirates you know?,2387
Hiyou,My opinion of you has improved a little bit. Just a little bit you hear!,2387
Hiyou,I've sent out all my planes. Right now there's just us two in here.,2388
Hiyou,This package? N-no I didn't buy it from Akashi's nor did I ask my friends for help I made it myself So that's it you're only paying attention to my chocolate. But even if I look like this I'm still quite good with housework. Hahaha,2388
Hiyou,I'm still no good at it but I tried my hand at homemade chocolate. Just don't compare it to anyone else's please. Especially not the other carriers'. Look I know you're not the kind of person to do that but What I'm trying to say is I'm uncharacteristically nervous!,2389
Honolulu,Why do I have to wait for you here,2389
Honolulu,Maintenance? Fine as long as you don't do anything weird,2390
Honolulu,I don't seem very Hawaiian even though my name is Honolulu? Well gee my bad,2390
Honolulu,I was born with this personality. I don't hate you or anything like that,2391
Honolulu,Do you just go around touching everyone you see? Do you need anything?,2391
Honolulu,*Sigh* If you're gonna be this direct then I don't even feel like getting mad at you,2392
Honolulu,If you have the time to stare at me how about you go finish your remaining missions?,2392
Honolulu,What you don't even want your rewards?,2393
Honolulu,Here mail for you. What? I can at least do something this simple for you,2393
Honolulu,Good work. What are you not satisfied until I say something mean?,2394
Honolulu,What are you waiting for A commission's been completed!,2394
Honolulu,I didn't really ask you for this,2395
Honolulu,All I need to do is get rid of these guys right?,2395
Honolulu,Is that enough for you?,2396
Honolulu,I don't want to go to Mare Island again,2396
Honolulu,This time things should go well!,2397
Honolulu,Do I really need to chat with you? But I guess I don't have anything else to do so I'll keep you company for a while.,2397
Honolulu,I think people are jealous of me because mine are bigger than theirs But personally I wish they were smaller. When they're big you know it's pretty inconvenient,2398
Honolulu,I don't really have anything going for me outside of my body but you're still being so nice to me Do you like my body THAT much? Even if you don't it's not like I No I'll stop myself right there because otherwise you'll just get carried away.,2398
Honolulu, Didn't I tell you they're not this big just because I wanted them to be? Well if you like them that much then maybe they're not so bad,2399
Honolulu,This is really embarrassing so could we just get this over with Y-you can do whatever you want when it's just the two of us,2399
Honolulu,I made you Valentine's chocolate Here. Thanks for everything Also I really put my heart into making Ughh N-never mind what I was saying I made these because I like baking that's all.,2400
Honolulu,Yeah I made Valentine's chocolate I followed the same recipe as always so it'll taste good. Although something still feels odd about sitting down just the two of us eating chocolate together I'm not saying I don't like it it's just I dunno. Hehe~,2400
Honolulu,Hrmh You're looking away again Here I made chocolate for W-would you look at me please? There's no one else around so don't worry about it I had to muster a lot of courage to get this far so at least return my effort with eye contact,2401
Honolulu,If everyone's focusing on the teacher they probably won't stare at me from up front As for the umbrella it's I know it makes me stand out but I don't want people to stare at me from behind either,2401
Honolulu,Y-you want to eat lunch together? Really? I bet you're just teasing me. Or are you just hoping to get a taste of Helena's cooking?,2402
Honolulu,I made a friend at school. He's brown cuddly and doesn't say a word though,2402
Honolulu,There's nobody who's like you at school. Nobody who sometimes makes me laugh sometimes makes me cry and sometimes Gosh what am I saying,2403
Honolulu,It's small but it's the only umbrella I could find. S-so when 2 people are sharing it i-it's only natural they'd have to stand so close together,2403
Honolulu,I-I don't have anything going for me besides my bust anyway,2404
Honolulu,"Don't say you'll ""see me after school"" O-or else I'll just stay behind",2404
Honolulu,*Gasp*! Where the heck is all this water coming from?!,2405
Honolulu,*Sob* Everyone's going to laugh at me,2405
Honolulu,You called over Helena?! This is NOT the way I want to make her laugh!,2406
Honolulu,If I get rid of everyone who saw me then I won't have anything to be embarrassed about!,2406
Honolulu,Today was your unlucky day because I'm in a REALLY bad mood!,2407
Honolulu,"Special Christmas lingerie"" I never should've listened to Louis! I need to put on this whole costume quick before someone sees me!",2407
Honolulu,*Sigh* Just thinking about that idiot standing behind me with a straight face makes all my motivation go away,2408
Honolulu,I-I tripped just a moment ago and these ribbons got all tangled up around me Ahahaha I'm such a klutz What are the ribbons for? U-uhh,2408
Honolulu,That's a wonderful Christmas tree? T-thanks Hey hold on don't you have anything else to say?!,2409
Honolulu,My plans for Christmas? Um let's see Hey hold on why are you asking that with a straight face to someone who's dressed like this?!,2409
Honolulu,Your mail? Oh no I forgot which box I put it in,2410
Honolulu,They're staring at me They're staring at me!,2410
Honolulu,I'll say this now: I don't like festivals in any Ah you know what never mind! Just come with me okay?!,2411
Honolulu,Wh-what are you staring at me for Is it weird to have fun at a festival now?,2411
Honolulu,Y-you saw how flustered I was just now didn't you I don't hate you or anything like that you know,2412
Honolulu,Don't make excuses I know you did that on purpose!,2412
Honolulu,Do you want this? Here take it,2413
Honolulu,Let's get this over with quick I wanna go back to the festival!,2413
Honolulu,After all that trouble putting this on This sucks,2414
Honolulu,"*Sigh* why can't I ever keep my composure in front of you ""What am I murmuring about""? N-nothing! I didn't say a word! Dummy!",2414

Hood,Even I am slightly angered.,2420
Hood,*Sigh* Seems like you must learn it the hard way.,2420
Hood,Hm? I'm too close? A lady must be elegant but they must also seize the initiative towards the targets of their own affection.,2421
Hood,Aha look how nervous you are. You can't convey your feelings to a lady when you're this nervous. However your feelings have definitely reached my heart I would happily oblige.,2421
Hood,If the smooth path only allows one person to travel at a time then I’ll gladly walk the path not taken with you hand-in-hand.,2422

Hood,I can see the whole harbor from the mountain top this is the best place to watch fireworks.,2424
Hood,To be elegant at all times is the mannerism befitting of a lady.,2425
Hood,Thank you for inviting me on this wonderful trip. Now that I have donned this beautiful outfit shall we partake of a Sakura Empire tea party– leisurely and elegantly?,2425
Hood,You can have some of the maid team's black tea if you'd like but why not try some of the Sakura Empire's green tea today?,2426
Hood,Rose patterns as well as our Royal Navy's motifs How splendid this is! I must express my gratitude to those who dyed this kimono.,2426

Hood,If you don't have a destination in mind why not simply enjoy the scenery all around us? For example the roses in full bloom in this garden.,2429
Hood,I can see that Bismarck is finally learning to shed the burdens placed upon her shoulders. Hehe don't you think she should be more true to her feelings?,2429
Hornet,Wanna hear about my older sisters? Hmmhmm now which of them are you smitten by?,2430

Hornet,I grow with each passing year and so do these feelings inside me. You know what I'm talking about – and what this chocolate represents don'tcha? It's something only I can give you – something no one else can do better!,2437
Hornet,"It's a party you gotta eat a lot! What if you eat too much? ""No problem just work out and sweat it off later!"" How's my Enty impression?",2437
Hornet,So I have to dress up like this for the party? Aren't you worried I'm gonna be a fish out of water in there?,2438
Hornet,I'm not expecting anyone to call me the belle of the ball tonight. Not while everyone else is dressed up all pretty-like. What? You think I give up too easily?,2438

Houshou,No shipgirls struggling to find chocolate ingredients this year. The preparations for the banquet are in order. Heehee that makes it worth all the work I put in ahead of time. Now I have chocolate for you. It is wonderful that you I and all the others can enjoy this day with smiles on our faces.,2450
Houshou,While everyone slips into sweet dreams from the night's festivities the sound of gossamer sliding off of smooth skin reaches your ears Hehe would you like to spend this night under the stars with me Master~?,2451
Houshou,At least for tonight I wish you and I to pursue the happiness of being together,2451
Houshou,Master what do you think of your Tanabata present? Are~ you~ satisfied~?,2452
Houshou,Hehe Master if your heart races then it's my victory~,2452

Howe,How nice to see you. Now let's get to work on today's tasks.,2459
Howe,To your friends show no cowardice; to your foes show no mercy – that is my creed. Hehehe~,2459
Howe,Wales and York are lovely ladies. At times however I struggle to keep up with their thought processes.,2460
Howe,George has always been good to me. She often treats me to a cookie or two But I wish she'd stop treating me like I'm still a child.,2460
Howe,If you have a hard time making friends with an eccentric person my advice is this: bake some cookies and offer to share with them.,2461
Howe,Do save the massage for later. I'm not tired yet.,2461
Howe,Umm What are you doing?,2462
Howe,Hm?,2462
Howe,Oh missions? Are there any I can help with?,2463
Howe,A mission's done. I can take care of claiming the rewards no problem.,2463
Howe,We've received what looks to be mail addressed to you.,2464
Howe,Nicely done out there. If you've got the energy to spare perhaps you could write an after-battle report?,2464
Howe,Do you need someone to escort the commission team home? I'm quite the experienced escort I'll have you know.,2465
Howe,Heheh there'll be no mercy for you!,2465
Howe,Heheh I'm in top shape today!,2466
Howe,Next time victory will be ours.,2466
Howe,My aim shall not waver!,2467
Howe,I can't falter now!,2467
Howe,A kind deed to others is a kind deed to yourself – or so I was naive enough to believe,2468
Howe,"Shape the world into God's vision"" – if there is a God what is his ideal world? It can't be one of perpetual war that's for sure.",2468
Howe,Pardon for making you wait love. I've baked you chocolate cookies.  If you can't finish them all free to give the remainder away. The whole world could use a cookie after all!,2469
Howe,That is the shared cookie box for everyone to take from. This on the other hand is your own box of special chocolate-chip cookies From deepening your friendships with people to more romantic moments like this any occasion is improved with a cookie~,2469
Howe,I make cookies not because I'm bad at chocolate or don't want to give you chocolate but because I think cookies are better for communicating my special feelings. Mm but I also make them for not-so-special feelings Huh.,2470
Howe,Welcome back. Can I keep you company until the night arrives love?,2470
Howe,My sisters can be rather headstrong at times. If they give you any trouble you can turn to me love.,2471
Howe,It seems my cookies were adored but my performance failed to garner any reactions,2471
Howe,You'd like a massage? It would be my pleasure.,2472
Howe,I can see why you'd do that. Hehehe~,2472
Howe,Splendid work love. Have a cookie and get some rest then we'll start on the after-battle report.,2473
Howe,Hehehe let's plan for our next date love. Speaking of which I've heard of a place with famously delicious cookies. How does that sound?,2473
Howe,Glad you could make it love. Now as for our plan today Oh should I not have made a plan ahead of time?,2474
Howe,Is this the place with the famously delicious cookies? Could we order some right away? I must taste them for myself!,2474
Howe,Peckish are you? Then you can have this cookie George gave me.,2475
Howe,This dress is quite comfortable actually. It's no trouble for me to walk a little longer.,2475
Howe,Have a seat if you need to rest love.,2476
Howe,Hm? Is there something on my dress?,2476
Howe,Well done on that sortie. Let's proceed with our plan shall we?,2477
Howe,I hope misfortune befalls you.,2477
Howe,"Please Master save meee."" Ugh I can't get into the role. What sort of tone should I be aiming for love?",2478
Howe,"Masteeer please untie meeee"" Hmm",2478
Howe,Oh who will come to my rescue? George? Or perhaps you love?,2479
Howe,Goodness These cookie props are so enticing they're distracting me,2479
Howe,"How do you think Belfast would respond if I walked up to her and said ""I'm joining the Royal Maids starting today""?",2480
Howe,Memorising my lines is simple enough. Reciting them is another matter though How does Wales do it so effortlessly?,2480
Howe,I'll bake you your favourite pastry later love.,2481
Howe,Master?,2481
Howe,Splendid work. I would offer you a treat but as you can see my hands are tied,2482
Howe,Swift and graceful I advance!,2482
Howe,"I'm curious what the Royal Maids mean when they say they ""service"" you Heheh. Would you mind enlightening me after this rehearsal love?",2483
Howe,What you think my dress is ludicrously posh? It should be considering what an important day this is What about it is so important you ask? Hm That is an excellent question.,2483
Howe,Monarch has me a tad bit concerned Ah no she fits in just fine I just wonder if she likes the food on offer.,2484
Howe,All these foreign dresses have me mesmerised. I'd love to try some on for myself someday.,2484
Howe,I don't want to stand out TOO much – you're the star of the show tonight after all.,2485
Howe,I can't walk all that fast in this outfit so be a sweetheart and escort me.,2485

Howe,A Royal Knight is not to be trifled with!,2487
Howe,That is what I call an elegant victory. Phew This will hopefully put George at ease.,2488
Hunter,I don't dislike Hardy. It's just that she tends to be annoying when she's around.,2488
Hunter,This isn't a hunting rifle. It's a torpedo tube.,2489
Hunter,What's the bounty this time?,2489
Hunter,What? You want me to sound the horn of victory?,2490
Hunter,Here's your mail. Is there any information on what we should hunt next?,2490
Hunter,You can never be too prepared.,2491
Hunter,Hm I guess I'll go for some bigger prey next time,2491
Hunter,I won't let you get away.,2492
Hunter,It's easy as long as I think of the enemy as my prey,2492
Hunter,The hunter can become the hunted at any point,2493
Hunter,You'll only suffer more the more you struggle.,2493
Hunter,The prey this time is pretty tough,2494
Hunter, (Hunter's companion barks at you),2494
Hunter,Is there a hunting ground around here?,2495
Hunter,There is no prey a hunter cannot take down. Any failure should be attributed to a lack of sufficient preparation.,2495
Hunter,"A hunter should always stalk his prey but having a base no a ""home"" doesn't sound bad at all.",2496
Hwah_Jah,That reminds me a while ago I raised my hand to try to join one of the Eagle Union girls' parties but they all looked at me like I was crazy Is there anything wrong with that?,2496
Hwah_Jah,"Be courteous to others so that they will listen to you respectfully. As for those unwilling to give you that respect there are always more ""direct"" methods you can employ~",2497
Hwah_Jah,Mapo tofu? There are hundreds of ways of preparing tofu and there's no rule saying it has to be spicy. Besides I'm not great with spicy food,2497
Hwah_Jah,Meh don't sweat it. Even if I slack off right now nobody's gonna find out.,2498

Hwah_Jah,Mission complete. So does that mean I can shoot the breeze for a while?,2499
Hwah_Jah,The friends from the commission fleet are back. Wanna throw a little party for them?,2499
Hwah_Jah,In other words we can go all-out now right?,2500
Hwah_Jah,"Heh. The character ""Jah"" in my name symbolizes number one. Quite apropos if I must say so myself.",2500
Hwah_Jah,I'll remember this humiliation and pay it back twofold!,2501
Hwah_Jah,If you won't listen to reason then you can talk to my fist!,2501
Hwah_Jah,Ugh I let my guard down,2502
Hwah_Jah,No matter what happens life must continue on. Just let it go,2502
Hwah_Jah,Thwap. Oh I didn't need anything from you. I just felt like giving you a good smack over the head with a fan for no reason. Heehee no harm no foul right?,2503
Hwah_Jah,So I was thinking If you aren't busy how about we head out and have some fun with our friends~,2503
Hwah_Jah,By any chance were you flirting with other girls while you were out? Heehee I was just messing with you. I wanted to see how you'd react that's all~,2504
Hwah_Jah,You're back? Let's go find our other friends and see if they're up to anything interesting.,2504
Hwah_Jah,Hmm? You think this outfit's a bit too revealing? Weird. I thought it's pretty in line with what everyone else is wearing Besides what's wrong with standing out a little?,2505
Hwah_Jah,The mandarin duck hotpot as its name implies is a special hotpot for couples Just kidding. Actually this partition is just to accommodate people's different tastes.,2505
Hwah_Jah,Hmm? Hai Tien made an incredibly spicy baozi? I sure hope she marked it properly,2506
Hwah_Jah,The jiangshi in the movies all hop around due to the whole rigor mortis thing. So it's kinda like this hip hop. Err umm this feels a little inappropriate.,2506
Hwah_Jah,I'm not actually dead y'know so I can't just make my hands turn ice-cold.,2507
Hwah_Jah,You're gonna be cursed if you remove the seal,2507
Hyuuga,Phew Wouldn't you agree that it's better to train from dusk until dawn instead of from dawn to dusk?,2508
Hyuuga,Ise please clean your room every now and then,2508
Hyuuga,It sure would be nice to meet Hatsushimo here.,2509
Hyuuga,Though the Age of Aviation has come it still isn't the Age of Aviation Battleships.,2509
Hyuuga,A veteran swordsman should be able to detect her opponent's energy before they get too close I still have a long way to go,2510
Hyuuga,Is this your stuff? Make sure to keep it in a safe place next time.,2510

Hyuuga,You should keep this kind of thing in your mind only Seriously how will people look at me if I wear this Hehe hehe hehe!,2515
Hyuuga,I've noticed you end up at a lot of drinking parties so let's at least go easy on your liver on Valentine's Day. Not saying there'll be no drinking today just that this chocolate will be a little more on the healthy side Huh? Have dinner together? Well sure I don't see why not,2516
Hyuuga,Hey please help me out with my training today!,2516
Hyuuga,Though battleships have seen better times I will not give up!,2517
Hyuuga,Ise's still behaving like she always has *Sigh*,2517
Hyuuga,It takes a lot of skill to use planes right I oughta ask for tips from someone with experience.,2518

Hyuuga,Prepared to pay for what you just did? You don't stand the shadow of a chance against me.,2519
Hyuuga,Artillery training and aviation training Guess that's the whole package.,2519
Hyuuga,Main guns: ready! Fire at will!,2520
I-13,There's only so many things a regular submarine can do. To turn the war around we need more wings in the air.,2520
I-13,The sea is the color of the sky. And the sky is the same color as me!,2521
I-13,There's the Type 97 and Type 99 the Suisei Tenzan Ryuusei Saiun and of course my Seiran. I know everything there is to know about aircraft!,2521
I-13,I'm okay with lending you my Seiran but it's veeeeery expensive! Break it and I'll be really angry okay?,2522
I-13,Don't make me pepper you with my Seiran's machine guns.,2522
I-13,Maybe I can fit a few more Seirans once I get stronger?,2523
I-13,Let's give it our best shot.,2523
I-13,This victory will be a great help to our other fleets.,2524
I-13,It's not good enough to be an ordinary submarine,2524
I-13,Here it comes Everything I'm capable of!,2525
I-13,I guess this is all a submarine can do,2525
I-13,You think I'm weird do you? Heheh maybe I am Just remember: there are only so many things a regular submarine can do. That's something I learned during my short time in service.,2526
I-13,It's Valentine's so I've got two gifts for you: chocolate and an airplane encyclopedia. Read through it while enjoying the chocolates You can enjoy both of course but you know what I mean.,2526
I-13,You've already gotten an airplane from me before but this time you're getting one made of chocolate. I based it off a number of different models of propeller and jet aircraft. Isn't it cute? Maybe I should've made this part bluer though Do you mind if I fix that right now?,2527
I-168,You're very late!  A submarine such as myself is extremely patient but that doesn't mean you can keep me waiting for this long,2527
I-168,You want something from me don't you?  Well even if you don't,2528
I-168,I'm tired I like it better in the ocean,2528
I-168,Hammann? If she wants to berate me then she can go ahead and try! I'll turn the tables on her!,2529

I-168,Hmph! If you prefer girls who are honest about their feelings why not hook up with someone more honest than me?  WHAT?! Hammann is NOT more honest with her feelings than me!,2537
I-168,F-finally you decided to open up to me You did right to choose me Ehehe W-what's that mean?! YOU'RE the one not being honest here!,2538

I-19,I should make some friends? But I don't need any~! You're the only person I need!,2554
I-19,Eek! The wind nearly Hmm? Were you trying to sneak a peek~?,2554
I-19,Hehehe~ Do you wanna walk to and from school with me?,2555
I-19,No touching until everyone else has gone home,2555
I-19,Mail? I hope it's not an angry letter from some teacher,2556

I-19,Hmm there's a lot of girls dressed like bunnies right now I'll try to be your most favorite one!,2563
I-19,It feels a little weird doing this in a bunny outfit,2563
I-25,Where I'm from we always offer our respects for the food in front of us before each meal. It's a custom that helps us be at ease.,2564
I-25,I hope my sister hasn't been causing too much trouble for you. She's a little ball of energy there's no way I can keep up with her,2564
I-25,These are the fruits of everyone's efforts. Make sure to receive them with pride.,2565
I-25,Everyone in the commission fleet has returned safely. Hmm should I reward them with some homemade chocolate?,2565
I-25,Sometimes you've got to stand out!,2566
I-25,Heehee from now on just leave it to me~,2566
I-25,Is everyone safe?,2567
I-25,Now's our time to attack!,2567
I-25,Now this is a bit of a sticky situation,2568
I-25,Though I am very sorry that it has come to this I must once again remind you that your poor work ethic has already affected the fleet.,2568
I-25,D-deep sea fish attack! Umm uh that's not how it works? I don't seem to be very good at this,2569
I-25,Which subjects am I good at? I'd say I'm pretty decent at all of them. Ehehe I did say you can leave everything to me.,2569
I-25,This might sound strange coming from me but forest fires are a very serious matter. There will be dire consequences if you don't take that to heart. Just ask the girls of the Eagle Union.,2570
I-25,There's nothing wrong with I-19 right The next time I-26 calls everyone to play I'll go check on her.,2570
I-25,Haah as long as you're by my side I feel safe and sound.,2571

I-25,If it's going to take a while to make your rounds go get my sister instead Actually wait can I come with you?,2572
I-25,M-my sister's going to get jealous,2573
I-25,Please rub my ears as well,2573
I-25,Haah haah Here this is for you~ I let the wine get to my head a little. Hehe~,2574

I-26,What about your mail? It was past the deadline so I disposed of it Juuust kidding! Here you go read it~,2578
I-26,A commission's done! Put me on the team for the next one! Disrupting trade is what I do best! Hehehe~,2579

I-26,Commence dive! Target spotted! Fire torpedoes! Kaboooom! See? It's pretty easy! Why don't you give it a try too?,2582
I-26,I wonder when you'll notice that um that your suit has a button loose! What were you expecting me to say? Hehehe~,2583
I-26,Hey let me borrow your shoulders Jumpity! Hehehe~ Light as a feather right? Bring me to the office if you will!,2583
I-26,I was wondering when this day would come but I never would've thought it'd be today I feel so happy that I could swim 100 laps around the port! Yeah! In fact let's go swimming right now together!,2584
I-26,I wanted to feel you by my side while I was making chocolate so I decided to make something that looks just like you! Whaddya think? Looks pretty accurate doesn't it? Ehehe~,2584
I-26,School's just boring compared to the ocean Like there's tons of undiscovered fish species and monsters down at the bottom of the ocean! I wish I could see how they look~,2585
I-26,Big fish eat regular fish. Regular fish eat small fish. Hang on what do small fish eat again?,2585
I-26,If you were an anglerfish you could work late at night without having to turn on the lights!,2586
I-26,It's not easy to swim without a swimsuit~ Baww,2586
I-26,You should give this anglerfish plushie a hug! It's really soft and cuddly!,2587
I-26,Haven't I told you I'm not a fish?!,2587

I-56,Next time I hope I don't get MVP,2592
I-56,Time to slink away quietly,2592
I-56,Y-you leave me no choice!,2593
I-56,L-Looks like I've drawn too much attention,2593
I-56,Leave Leave me alone,2594
I-56,If you don't want to get caught up in bothersome things it's probably better to be like thin air and not stand out,2594
I-56,Everyone in the fleet gets along so well Ehe hehehe Um it's nothing l-leave me alone,2595
I-56,From time to time my thoughts slip out when I'm muttering to myself D-don't read too much into it,2595
I-56,It's really amazing to see everyone helping each other make chocolate like that B- but I would only get in the way and mess things up if I tried to join in,2596
I-56,Hope this is g-good enough Hmm Don't get me wrong I'm really glad you accept my Valentine's chocolate but I dunno I just wish I could see how you and I look from an outsider's perspective,2596
I-56,It's a bittersweet feeling watching others make chocolate from the sidelines and talking about romance But bittersweet is good. Of course I'm happy to give you chocolate but I think I also enjoy seeing how other people spend their Valentine's Day.,2597
I-56,School is pretty nice. I can quietly stay in this corner and mind my own business,2597
I-56,At school you can see a completely different side of people. It can be pretty interesting,2598
I-56,I've received invitations from several clubs before but I still prefer to watch others from a distance.,2598
I-56,I hope this doesn't get in the way of my school attendance,2599
I-58,I love the serenity of the night. Nobody ever notices my presence.,2599
I-58,It's not like I'll die if I'm taken out of the ocean but I definitely prefer being in it. *blub blub*,2600
I-58,There are a lot of miraculous things in the ocean. Want to go on a dive with me and experience it for yourself?,2600
I-58,I mean I'll admit they're on the small side but that makes it more hydrodynamic!,2601
I-58,New missions? Is there something that I can do?,2601
I-58,These mission rewards there's nothing that can be brought underwater,2602
I-58,Mhm my body feels lighter.,2602
I-58,I'll let the rest of you handle the anti-sub.,2603
I-58,Is that all you surface-lubbers are made of?,2603
I-58,I've been found huh Next time I've got to be sneakier,2604
I-58,Can you predict where I'm going to attack from?,2604
I-58,Seems that I'm being targeted,2605
I-58,Does this fleet exist only to wage war?,2605
I-58,"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step?"" Hmm I suppose I can start by saying hello to her",2606
I-58,I modeled this chocolate after my favorite seashell from my collection. Isn't it fascinating how shells take on totally different shapes through evolution from simple shapes to long spirals? Anyway it might look a bit odd but it should taste good.,2606
I-58,Here's your yearly chocolate. By the way are you free? I wanted to show you the ocean floor so I found some places where you could go with lots of shells. If it's not a bother we could go right now?,2607
Ibuki,Milord you must be tired.,2607
Ibuki,Milord w-welcome I wasn't able to prepare much for your arrival but would you like some tea?,2608
Ibuki,Spending time alone with Milord somehow makes my heart pound,2608
Ibuki,Milord if you have no further orders for me may I go over there to meditate?,2609
Ibuki,In order to hone my swordsmanship I practice my strokes a thousand times every day Don't worry Milord I already finished while you were gone.,2609
Ibuki,You'd like me to put on a show? S-Sorry in front of other people I can't,2610
Ibuki,Clear the mind and purify the six roots Eek! Mi Milord,2610
Ibuki,We seem to have new missions. Would you like Ibuki to accompany you?,2611
Ibuki,Milord there's a big pile of stuff over there Um are those the rewards then?,2611
Ibuki,Milord your mail Huh? You'd like me to read it? B-but that's embarrassing,2612
Ibuki,Milord if you are ever injured please allow Ibuki to treat you with this mugwort liniment. There's still a lot left.,2612
Ibuki,Milord the comm Um whatever these are called. Yes they're done now.,2613
Ibuki,Is this the sensation of getting stronger? Thank you!,2613
Ibuki,The battlefield is callous Ibuki advancing!,2614
Ibuki,My skills are but party tricks unworthy of such praise.,2614
Ibuki,Ugh I must increase my training multifold.,2615
Ibuki,The pinnacle of Ibuki resides in this single strike!,2615
Ibuki,A fight with our backs to the wall?  Exactly what I wanted!,2616
Ibuki,Had I known I would have to serve a person like you I never would have manifested during this era,2616
Ibuki,I would also enjoy a life of sitting atop the mountains watching the clouds pass through the sky. But my current life here isn't so bad either.,2617
Ibuki,I'm cool you say? If anything I am somewhat jealous of how everyone can always have a smile on their faces In contrast I simply do not know how to express my emotions,2617
Ibuki,After spending a lot of time with everyone else I've experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to express my emotions clearly such as joy and love,2618
Ibuki,The mugwort on Mount Ibuki is said to symbolize love that burns quietly F-For example right now Milord can you feel Ibuki's heart?,2618
Ibuki,I never knew that having my feelings be reciprocated could be so overwhelmingly joyful Milord p-please don't look at me I'm so happy that my face must look strange,2619
Ibuki,Through study I have come to acquire not only experience and techniques but I feel I have also accumulated feelings toward Milord. I want to thank Milord and make Milord happy in all ways forever Milord please accept these feelings of mine!,2619
Ibuki,Milord I heard that there were two types of Valentine's chocolates—obligatory ones and romantic ones. I'm so very now As a ship and your subordinate I understand that i ought to give you obligatory chocolate but i also want to be your number one priority and express my romantic feelings to you Milord what course of action should I take?,2620
Ibuki,If you would come this way Milord. Here we will surely be able to experience the elegant fragrance of a new spring from atop this vantage point Here should you be feeling fatigued please fill your stomach with some of Ibuki's handmade chocolate Y-you'd feel bad eating it?,2620
Ibuki,I've been training nonstop in order to create a chocolate that symbolizes my duty as a shipgirl my desire to be Milord's favorite and my genuine feelings toward you! M-milord is this chocolate enough to make me your number one?,2621
Ibuki,Milord it's starting to snow If it suits you please take shelter under Ibuki's umbrella.,2621
Ibuki,Milord shall we go outside together?,2622
Ibuki,I'll have to thank Houshou for this lovely kimono,2622
Ibuki,Achoo! I'm cute when I sneeze? D- don't make fun of me,2623
Ibuki,This is real snow beautiful,2623
Ibuki,Aren't there some big festivals in the wintertime? I guess you could say I'm a little interested only a little!,2624
Ibuki,Is there someplace you'd like to go Milord? Of course I'll accompany you.,2624
Ibuki,Um Milord your hands are cold,2625
Ibuki,The snow is coming down outside Milord let me get an extra sweater for you.,2625
Ibuki,The winter in my timeless slumber was silent and cold. But here at Milord's side I feel only warmth Milord would you take my hand?,2626
Ibuki,This is my first time wearing Western clothes Um Milord! Does this outfit suit Ibuki well?,2626
Ibuki,"I am unsure how I should conduct myself at a ""banquet"" Milord may I just follow you?",2627
Ibuki,These foreign beverages and teas have quite a distinctive flavor,2627
Ibuki,There are so many things at this banquet that I simply do not understand Ah please don't get the wrong idea I merely realized that there is much for me to learn still.,2628
Ibuki,Actually it was Miss Seattle who invited me here She's quite a charismatic person.,2628
Ibuki,Though I prefer my outings to be a bit more introspective I don't mind the camaraderie and joyfulness here.,2629
Ibuki,Milord it feels nice when the wind gently strokes my cheeks.,2629
Ibuki,D-do these clothes not suit me after all?,2630
Ibuki,Milord please try this cake. It's fluffy sweet and delicious.,2630
Ibuki,"The Dragon Empery's ""Spring Festival"" is filled with fun liveliness and pure jubilation. I can feel my true feelings welling up Maybe an environment like this would suit me pretty well",2631
Ibuki,The warm glow of the lanterns and the vivid red decorations it's all so beautiful,2631
Ibuki,Hmm I'm a lot more outgoing than usual? Maybe the festive atmosphere is rubbing off on me. Milord do you think I'm acting strange?,2632
Ibuki,Milord Ibuki will be performing a sword dance at the Spring Festival banquet tonight Um it's my first time performing in front of everyone so I'm a bit nervous,2632
Ibuki,Milord Miss Akashi seems to be selling firecrackers. I heard they are a bit like fireworks Huh? They are firecrackers right?,2633
Ibuki,"Around this time the cold begins to recede. Soon spring shall arrive I see so this is why people hang ""fai chun"" on the walls",2633
Ibuki,"I'm glad you've returned Milord. I've changed my attire in order to better carry out your order–for us to ""relax together."" Now then could you please instruct me on how to proceed?",2634
Ibuki,*Yaaawn* Milord please relax and make yourself at home.,2634
Ibuki,Milord is the tea I prepared to your liking?,2635
Ibuki,Milord I shall now continue my meditation Oh y-you'd like to talk to me?,2635
Ibuki,Milord could you please arrange some work for me? I'm feeling a little fidgety,2636
Ibuki,Milord what would you have me do?,2636
Ibuki,Milord?! H-have I done something to displease you?,2637
Ibuki,Milord?,2637
Ibuki,Milord you have new mail. Um Shall I read it aloud for you?,2638
Ibuki,Milord I'll protect you!,2638
Ibuki,"Milord I've prepared your tea. Phew Even though we're spending all this time together doing nothing I still feel fulfilled. Mm this overflowing emotion Milord is this what ""love"" is?",2639
Icarus,I guess destroyers really have their limits If only I had bigger guns or torpedoes Oh I was just talking to myself. Please don't mind me!,2639
Icarus,Was there something you wanted me to do?,2640
Icarus,I-I'm not sure if we should be doing this,2640
Icarus,Hehehe. You know this feels kind of nice.,2641
Icarus,There's a new mission. Let's do our best!,2641
Icarus,The mission's been completed! How wonderful!,2642
Icarus,I've finished sorting out the new mail! Should I bring it over?,2642
Icarus,Alright! Let's go all-out!,2643
Icarus,If only I could have shot another volley of torpedoes,2643
Icarus,Loading complete Let's go!,2644
Icarus,My torpedoes still aren't ready I can hold out for a bit longer!,2644
Icarus,Mm The more I stay by your side the more I want to do your work in your stead Do you think I'm getting a bit too attached to you?,2645
Icarus,Just as I've become unable to part with you have you come to feel the same way about me? I'm so happy! From now on I'll be sure to ask you for lots of things,2645
Icarus,"(You received Icarus' Valentine's present right as you finished the day's work. You opened the box and saw a heap of chocolate and a handwritten note. It reads: ""Great job today. I've memorised your schedule down to the second so I'll come over later with some tea. Until then take your time and enjoy yourself."")",2646
Icarus,Whenever I play hide-and-seek I usually find everyone intuitively Perhaps I'm better at it than I thought?,2646
Icarus,I'm right over here~ Please let me know if you need anything!,2647
Icarus,If you're g-going to do something like this shouldn't we go elsewhere?,2647
Icarus,"You who are like the sun"" No that's not quite it. If I were to say what you are really like Maybe a space heater? Warm to be around without the danger of being burned Look even if I'm sticking to you this closely I'm still not burned! Hehe~",2648
Icarus,This is a special exercise for our on-site medical facilities! Well that's what they said anyway but isn't this kind of weird? I feel like I'd rather be taking care of others not the other way around,2648
Icarus,I've already prepared your changes of clothing and daily necessities in advance. Make sure you don't neglect your health while I'm away participating in this exercise alright?,2649
Icarus,Looking out the window of this hospital room at the scenery is making me oddly emotional,2649
Icarus,These bandages and this IV are just here for practice. They're not the real deal you know?,2650
Icarus,It's hard to move around properly in this I'm sure there will be an impact on my firepower too,2650
Icarus,I wonder if I should just let the Royal Maids clean your room instead,2651
Icarus,The manjuus and I are all ready to go! You can start taking pictures whenever you're ready.,2651
Icarus,No matter how many times I see it it never gets old It's simply amazing that we're able to create amazing sets like this at the Port.,2652
Icarus,So this is what the submarine girls see while they battle Hehe the scenery down here is amazing.,2652
Icarus,This swimsuit fits me nice and tight. It's so easy to move around in it!,2653
Icarus,Comparing me to the Royal Maids is like comparing night and day. There's no way I'd be able to measure up to true professionals.,2653
Icarus,Is this also part of the duties of a maid?,2654
Ikazuchi,"I see! You just ""logged in"" didn't you? Human language sure is profound",2654
Ikazuchi,If you bow deep and beg for it I'll make your wishes basically come true!  It didn't work? Um well that's because you haven't wished hard enough yet!,2655
Ikazuchi,"I see! So Inazuma-chan landed the ""First Strike"" in the World War!",2655
Ikazuchi,"I see! This is one of those ordinary ""greeting"" things right?",2656
Ikazuchi,Uh umm is this what I think it is? I know full well the meaning of w-what you did! I-I see,2656
Ikazuchi,You haven't finished the mission?  That sounds about as bad as not finishing your job.,2657
Ikazuchi,I see! This is that thingy! The thing you need to bring with you to be let into that one chocolate factory!,2657
Ikazuchi,Times like these call for fine wine and good food! Hard work shouldn't go unnoticed and all that! Hm? Where do we get it from? From the dorm! There's plenty of it there!,2658
Ikazuchi,"If you let a completed commission just sit there does it gain any ""interest""?",2658
Ikazuchi,"I'd rather have my ""ratings""""likes""and ""gimme"" stats enhanced instead!",2659
Ikazuchi,I see! So all we need to do is press that auto button in the top left and we'll be fine!,2659
Ikazuchi,"I see! Now this is what you should expect of someone as ""prestigious"" as me! Er or was it ""pretentious""?",2660
Ikazuchi,I see! Times like these you should P2GSOE2PTG4U! Pay to get someone else to play the game for you! Or you can just let me handle it instead!,2660
Ikazuchi,I see! This means that if I just let myself get washed away by the ocean then I can come back home,2661
Ikazuchi,It's my birthday tomorrow. Have you gotten a gift for me yet? You didn't know it was my birthday? Ah well see that pendant over there? Buy it and give it to someone you like I'm sure they'll be delighted!,2661
Ikazuchi,"I see! This thing making my heart race is called ""love""! Alright I understand. That means! W-wha? I feel so lightheaded It feels like the world's spinning around me Is this ""love"" too?",2662
Ikazuchi,"I see I see! So this is what you call a ""route split"" then! By making this difficult decision you've raised the Ikazuchi flag! Since you chose me I'll give you my handmade chocolate. Good luck with my route!",2662
Ikazuchi,It smells so so good Ikazuchi just can’t take it anymore and wants to have a bite.,2663
Ikazuchi,That being the case! What would Ikazuchi be like in another world then?,2663
Ikazuchi,"We thought Akatsuki had gotten lost again but Hibiki seems to have bumped into her. I see I see so that's what we call a ""random encounter!",2664
Ikazuchi,How am I supposed to fly with only one wing? Well even if I had two it probably still wouldn't work out!,2664
Illustrious,Could you help me pick up that handkerchief? I'd lose my balance if I try to pick it up myself,2665
Illustrious,Have you seen where did I put my planes? Oh? Right in front of me? Sorry something blocked my line of sight.,2665
Illustrious,Feeling tired? Relax for a while. How about a massage?,2666
Illustrious,The light shall disperses the fog of darkness. Oh? The girls are back!,2666
Illustrious,This way we can radiate our brilliance even further.,2667
Illustrious,Why cause unnecessary conflict?,2667
Illustrious,The light shines upon our land of triumph.,2668
Illustrious,Let's retreat lest I lose my life,2668
Illustrious,Holy light grant me power!,2669
Illustrious,Not even my light can reach the darkness within your heart?,2669
Illustrious,The end of sorrow the beginning of happiness and the desire for eternity.,2670
Illustrious,When will true peace come to these waters?,2670
Illustrious,Just whisper in my ear if you have anything to say~! *giggles*,2671
Illustrious,I'm not opposed to intimacy every now and then~!,2671
Illustrious,I look like a princess from a foreign country? Hehe you're making me blush,2672
Illustrious,It is my honour to get to wear another faction's garments. However this traditional Dragon Empery dress feels rather tight around the chest area,2672
Illustrious,All these Iris flowers are not just for showy decoration they make for some aromatherapy as well. Hehe.,2673
Illustrious,These Dragon Empery decorations all have a certain unique charm to them don't they?,2673
Illustrious,Is there something you would like to do with me?,2674
Illustrious,Just this once on this special day I'll indulge your childishness~ Hehehe.,2674
Illustrious,You're looking well. What good news have you brought Illustrious today?,2675
Impero,Evening. *yawn* I'm going to sleep. Wake me when it's sortie o'clock.,2675
Impero,Need something? Come back in 3 hours after I've had my bath. But if it's urgent join me in the bathtub and we'll discuss it.,2676
Impero,Is Veneto still up? She has this splendrous aura when she's awake. It's dazzling genuinely.,2676
Impero,The only things I need in life are bread and my smartphone. Wait Oxy-cola too. Oh and warm baths,2677
Impero,You could build a slide outside the office window that leads to my dorm room for quick access. Great idea right?,2677
Impero,Ready to kneel before me yet?,2678
Impero,Sleazebag.,2678
Impero,You really like playing with my hair huh?,2679
Impero,Missions hmm? Completing them is key to furthering Sardegna's splendor.,2679
Impero,Mission complete at the cost of nearly all my precious energy Take it from here.,2680
Impero,Seems the wind brought this letter straight to your desk. Oh you saw me bring it in? Welp.,2680
Impero,You've returned. Now where's my thank-you for getting up to bid you welcome back?,2681
Impero,The commission team's back. Go give them my regards.,2681
Impero,*yawn*,2682
Impero,Gaze upon Sardegna's splendor – MY splendor!,2682
Impero,Daring to pick a fight with the brilliant Impero isn't heroic. It's just foolish.,2683
Impero,They caught wind of my spaghetti planes? I see Sorry. This is my fault.,2683
Impero,Kneel before me!,2684
Impero,If I must exercise my brilliance so be it!,2684
Impero,Get out of my sight. I've no need for a snake like you.,2685
Impero,There needn't be a reason why I'm brilliant. Brilliance is inherent self-apparent and unmistakable for anything else. Veneto said that so yeah.,2685
Impero,I could do nothing – not even lift a finger – and I'd still contribute to Sardegna. To serve you however I have to put in real work.,2686
Impero,I did a task for you. It was sloppy but I'm not used to doing work so cut me some slack. Nobody's born knowing how to work are they? My point is Exactly. I appreciate the compliment.,2686
Impero,Evening You're not tired right before work? Darn I was hoping we could nap together.,2687
Impero,"Whew nothing beats a good bath Huh? What do you mean ""what's with the towel""? I just got out of the bath that's what?",2687
Impero,Littorio! Is dinner ready yet? Don't forget I'm brilliant. I'll starve to death if you take too long.,2688
Impero,Need some help with that? You can do it on your own? Geesh soon there'll be nothing left for me to do.,2688
Impero,It's nice being a carrier. I don't need to get my hands dirty all I have to do is pilot my planes. I'm so brilliant for being able to fight on my own.,2689
Impero,Is dinner ready?! Not yet huh,2689
Impero,I love when you do this,2690
Impero,Mhh That's nice. Do it again.,2690
Impero,Missions hmm? Completing them is key to promoting your brilliance and Sardegna's splendor.,2691
Impero,Brought you the mission rewards! Oof! They're a lot heavier than I expected.,2691
Impero,A carrier pigeon I wish I could fly like a bird. A rigging upgrade might make that possible.,2692
Impero,You've returned. I got you something to snack on. How nice of me right? You may thank me with a headpat.,2692
Impero,I'm brilliant aren't I? Yeah I am Hehehe.,2693
Impero,We don't have to do anything today. You heard me – you can be like me and just not do anything productive. And if you do something wild I'll let it slide.,2693
Impero,Evening. Here's what I'm doing to further Sardegna's splendor today Zzz,2694
Impero,Bookmarks are a genius invention. They save me the effort of remembering how far into a book I am.,2694
Impero,Zzz Oops I nodded off. If you wanna borrow a book go ahead. Anyway *yawn* Hang on what page was I on again?,2695
Impero,You here to return a book or?,2695
Impero,Mgh. Hm? Huh?,2696
Impero,These mission rewards let me read a few minutes more. Brilliant.,2696
Impero,Ah you're back. You hungry? I'm kind of famished so let's hit the cafeteria in a few.,2697
Impero,Now I can read another three pages. Awesome.,2697
Implacable,Why the long face? Concerned about your friends at sea or simply stressed over work? Don't bottle up your feelings – let it all out.,2698
Implacable,Tell me among the four Illustrious sisters whose tea is your favourite? Ah you want to know mine? Hmm I'd say it's the robust Assam.,2698
Implacable,Brain fog you say? I may have just the cure – Royal Navy cuisine enhanced with tongue-sizzling spice. Care for a taste?,2699
Implacable,Excuse me? Do you want the same done to you? Heehee♥,2699
Implacable,Are you tired of performing your neverending duty? Heehee. Here I thought you enjoyed it considering how unswerving your commitment is.,2700
Implacable,A mission's been completed has it? Heehee. May this bounty bring you joy one doesn't find every day.,2700
Implacable,There's a letter for you. Remember people have high hopes for you and you're not one to disappoint.,2701
Implacable,Oh welcome back The stuff in your cup looks off? You mean the tea I brewed for you? Why?,2701
Implacable,The commission team has come back. You arriving on scene quickly to thank them is the best reward they could ask for.,2702
Implacable,A blessing straight from you? Heehee. Allow me to give you my own blessings~,2702
Implacable,In Her Majesty's name I shall vanquish the wrongdoers.,2703
Implacable,We should celebrate this triumph. After all Lady Luck only lifts the hem of her dress to those who'll look,2703
Implacable,This defeat is like a stain on a white veil Tiny yet vexing.,2704
Implacable,Think you can stop me?,2704
Implacable,Heehee. I'll get you for this.,2705
Implacable,Surrender to darkness if you wish but where should those who see you as their light go?,2705
Implacable,My name suggests I'm vindictive: unwilling to offer mercy or compassion. In truth I simply believe in my loyalties and convictions. As someone with great responsibility surely you agree it's best not to fixate on the little things.,2706
Implacable,What I desire is more than a mere symbol of victory – I crave someone who will answer my thoughts sentiments desires and expectations. In other words Indeed if you do not know how to do so why not try listening to my every word from now on? Heehee~♥,2706
Implacable,Strong sentiments – be they faith or lust – do not necessarily lead to sin. There's no fun in being a slave to your conscience. If I were to offer myself to you no strings attached whatsoever gladly accepting is the right thing to do.,2707
Implacable,Love arises from the human's primordial desire for companionship. Once someone beckons you it only makes sense to cast aside your doubts and indulge in that sweet succulent euphoria Heehee. Yet you seem to have difficulty accepting this. Deny yourself all you want. Seeing how long you can fight your urges is fun in its own way.,2707
Implacable,You still deny yourself? Heehee I understand. The shackles of inhibition are hard to break. Just close your eyes relax and empty your mind as I've taught you. I'm going to give you a mark of pleasure that will never go away♥,2708
Implacable,While there are many who'll give their all for you I'm the only one who can answer your prayers at the moment. Heehee♥,2708
Implacable,If you're bored we can go look if the canteen's offering anything new. Let's also pop down to the shop and see what's on sale. Heehee. If you want to kill time might as well do it with me right?,2709
Implacable,You're grimacing again Fine. Come here and lie down. I'll help you let out all those woes and pent-up stress.,2709
Implacable,I don't mind if you're biased or pick favourites just don't look away when we're all to ourselves. If you do Well I'll put a curse on you. Heehee♥,2710
Implacable,Virtuous people losing their way heroes giving in to corruption Those who've grown bored of conventional stories find a guilty pleasure in such things.,2710
Implacable,While Illustrious is a great teacher during exercises Indomitable seems hellbent on always cutting corners Maybe they bore her and all she wants is to go home and chat over tea. Heehee.,2711
Implacable,Will you say the words or do you want me to do it? Heehee,2711
Implacable,You wouldn't hesitate on the battlefield would you? Go on show me how brave you are♥,2712
Implacable,Say Isn't there even a chance you'll drink my tea? You could at least pretend to sip it to let me feel good about myself.,2712
Implacable,It's wrong to pray only for you and nobody else. However you're the very person who pushed me in this direction. It is your mistake – do you know what you must do to rectify it? Yes you do. You have to throw reason to the wayside and let your throbbing heart take over. Heehee~♥,2713
Implacable,You will surely have a blessed day. Why? Because I'm attracting all the bad luck,2713
Implacable,Gosh I'm soaked What a pain. Should I go get changed after all?,2714
Implacable,"As it turns out the cafeteria's ""ultra spicy"" meal isn't very spicy at all. Maybe I'll make note of that on the next school survey.",2714
Implacable,"I assume you've already given some thought to how to deal with ""eccentric"" pupils? Heehee. I'm interested to see how you ""educate"" those who step out of line♥",2715
Implacable,You've been waiting for this chance to make your move haven't you? Heehee♥,2715
Implacable,Oh my are you trying to take advantage of me when I'm vulnerable~?,2716
Implacable,The supplies seem to have arrived. Hmm Surely you don't plan on making poor little me fetch them?,2716
Implacable,It's time to see the results of your studies. Don't let me down,2717
Implacable,Nothing makes a teacher happier than seeing her pupils get good results,2717
Implacable,Ugh Sorry I should've been more diligent.,2718
Inazuma,Naka she's helped me quite a lot,2718
Inazuma,"Salvaging"" is my specialty!",2719
Inazuma,"If you leave your missions unfinished forever then you'll end up having to do this bad thing called ""overtime"".",2719
Inazuma,This month's bonus pay won't be postponed into the next month.,2720
Inazuma,You have mailophobia?  You don't have to be scared I'm here with you.,2720
Inazuma,Phew I'm glad that didn't hurt as much as I thought.,2721
Inazuma,Hm Huh?! We've been ambushed!,2721
Inazuma, I'M the MVP?  Is this fleet doing okay?,2722
Inazuma,If only everyone were here with us,2722
Inazuma,A shared sorrow is one made half and shared joy is one made double. So please feel free to talk to me about anything.,2723
Inazuma,Thank you for choosing me. Are you happy you did? It must be so hard to choose a single member of the 6th DesDiv. For making such a hard choice you deserve this chocolate. If you'd like to thank me consider providing me with a new change of clothes.,2723
Inazuma,I usually go to festivals with Ikazuchi but this would be my first time going with you. Hmm? Where should we visit first?,2724
Inazuma,Akatsuki said she wanted to join us so we can have a 6th DesDiv get-together at the party but she seems to have gotten lost on the way I hope Hibiki is able to find her.,2724
Inazuma,"The moon is beautiful tonight"" is supposed to be a pretty famous line right? Eh How'd you already know about it Ikazuchi?",2725
Inazuma,Ikazuchi seems to have brought you some strawberries. Judging from your expression I'm supposed to bring you blueberries?,2725
Inazuma,Whether you are fighting taking care of commissions or just checking daily missions I will always be waiting for you here.,2726
Independence,I'm prepared to battle at nighttime if necessary.,2726
Independence,"Should I call Cleveland ""Cleve""? Or do I keep it simple?",2727
Independence,Yes? Do you need something?,2727
Independence,Go to the Admiralty and explain yourself. Right now.,2728
Independence,A new mission has come in. Let's get it done ASAP.,2728
Independence,We've got to stay diligent even after all our missions are complete.,2729
Independence,I've brought your mail. Give it a read.,2729
Independence,Should we draft a plan for the next operation?,2730
Independence,The goods from that commission have arrived. Saves us time having to carry it by hand.,2730
Independence,How about we set up a naval exercise right away?,2731
Independence,Stay focused and be on your guard!,2731
Independence,Never underestimate a CVL's capabilities.,2732
Independence,Retreating is a legitimate tactic,2732
Independence,Target locked!,2733
Independence,How many How many chances at victory do we have left?,2733
Independence,Allow me to be blunt: what the hell is wrong with you?,2734
Independence,You're curious how nighttime carrier battles look? Got it. I'll inform you next time there's one on the exercise schedule.,2734
Independence,A CVL might never rival an ordinary CV in terms of sheer power but I just want you to recognize what I'm capable of.,2735
Independence,Isn't there something you want to tell me? Be it combat-related or anything else. Why do I ask? Because I want to know what sort of place I have in your heart.,2735
Independence,"There are some things you can't express through words""? I don't follow. If you don't tell people how you feel how would they know? For instance how would you be able to guess that I love you if I didn't say it directly?",2736
Independence,It's thanks to our fateful encounter at the crossroads of life that I found the place where I belong Was that a weird way to put it? Umm well you know what I mean. I just can't find the right words In any case I'm happy to be together with you!,2736
Independence,You always do so much for me so it's time I do something for you. Unless you'd rather be alone I'll stay with you for the whole day helping you out with work and anything else you want. To start with you want chocolate from me? Absolutely. Here you are.,2737
Independence,How do you want me to assist you today? Chocolate? Sure I can help with part of that. If you mean mine specifically you'll have to wait a while. First you have to come up with a plan for how to handle everyone's heartfelt gifts and thoughts. It'd be stupid to sit around eating chocolate without a plan no?,2737
Independence,Light carrier Independence reporting. Retrofitting complete. I'm ready to take on harder more vital missions. Leave anything like that to me.,2738
Independence,I am fully accustomed to my new weaponry. My next battles will be legendary in naval history. Okay maybe not to that extent.,2738
Independence,I should probably hang out with my own sisters as much as I hang out with Cleveland,2739
Independence,I've finished all the work you assigned me. Proofread it at your leisure.,2739
Independence,Even I someone who's terrible at inferring people's feelings can clearly see how passionately Princeton is about her goals.,2740
Independence,Are we sortieing? Or is there administrative work to do around the port? Either way leave it to me.,2740
Independence,What the–?!,2741
Independence,Commission goods have arrived. I'll help transport them of course.,2741
Independence,Nothing can stand between my wings and the skies!,2742
Independence,So this is my new school huh? Hmm gotta put my stuff down first before checking in with the teacher.,2742
Independence,Living in a dorm means I don't have to worry about being late for school.,2743
Independence,Yeah it should be fine to leave my pet in the dorm I think?,2743
Independence,Join a club? Maybe I should Hmm Actually I'm good.,2744
Independence,Both studies and missions require your full undivided attention.,2744
Independence,Do you not get what this paragraph means? Let me have a look.,2745
Independence,Go to the staff room and explain yourself.,2745
Independence,Now what's our next subject?,2746
Independence,I won by making use of the things I learned. That's all there's to it!,2746
Independence,"There are a lot of really stunning goods here but the price tags on some of these are also very ""stunning"" Wh-why don't we start by looking through the more cost-effective stuff first",2747
Independence,Forcing you to help me make all these decisions is a little embarrassing but thanks for bearing with me. You've been a great help.,2747
Independence,"I also chose a getup for my partner here Hehe doesn't it give off ""gentlemanly"" vibes?",2748
Independence,Makeup? Uh I'm not well-versed in that stuff so I guess I'll pick up a little bit of everything. I'll try asking around for help after we get back!,2748
Independence,You want me to try these shoes on? Um s-sure. Just give me a moment.,2749
Independence,Whew A bit of stretching helps keep the body flexible. Hm? I'm in loungewear what about it? I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stare too much though,2749
Independence,Saratoga and Lexington do stretches on the regular giving them great dexterity for aircraft carriers. They really live up to their rep as idols. Good examples of hard work paying off too.,2750
Independence,Who's the most dexterous among the Cleveland class? If I had to guess Columbia. She does ballet you know.,2750
Independence,Even the most basic of stretches qualify as exercise. Though I'll admit it's not very rigorous exercise.,2751
Independence,Long Island claims mastering yoga gives you the power to breathe fire and extend your arms. I don't buy that idea though.,2751
Independence,Yeah that's it. Push on my back and hold it like that.,2752
Independence,I appreciate your help with the pushes but now you're just pushing your luck.,2752
Independence,Feel like doing some stretches with me? I could use a hand with a couple of moves like the forward bend for instance.,2753
Independence,Just need to feed it a coin then operate the crane with the joystick Oh! I got one! That was easier than I expected.,2753
Independence,"Who put this crane game here? ""Supplied by Akashi nya""? That's what it says on the back?",2754
Independence,By the way have you seen my pet eagle? Do you think he flew off somewhere? Wait he's not in the crane game is he?!,2754
Independence,Apparently if you bang on a machine hard enough you might get lucky and get a prize for free. Though it's more likely to get you in trouble than anything else.,2755
Independence,I've heard there's a café run by the Sakura Empire nearby. Why don't we stop by there later for a drink?,2755
Independence,You ought to get some fresh air to cool that hot head of yours,2756
Independence,I got a prize on my first try so I tried it a few more times but the crane wouldn't move like I wanted it to and loosened up as soon as it grabbed something. What a failure. I thought I'd try again only to find out I was all out of coins.,2756
Indianapolis,What are you looking at? My skin color has always been light brown it's not a tan.,2757
Indianapolis,To be honest I can't really have a proper conversation with other people,2757
Indianapolis,Whew,2758
Indianapolis,Mission unfinished,2758
Indianapolis,I brought the rewards.,2759
Indianapolis,Here mail.,2759
Indianapolis, Is it already over?,2760
Indianapolis, I almost forgot to report it but a commission's been completed.,2760
Indianapolis, I feel the power surging through me.,2761
Indianapolis,I'm the captain Wait I'm the captain?!,2761
Indianapolis,Hey I think we won,2762
Indianapolis,? It's my turn? Got it.,2762
Indianapolis, Oops.,2763
Indianapolis,My sister's always talking about how cute I am but if she'd just focus a little more on herself I'm sure she'd be popular That's why I've always felt a little guilty about her,2763
Indianapolis,I'm not as cheerful as my sister nor do I look as good as her yet you still chose me That makes me a little no it makes me very happy,2764
Indianapolis,I'm really happy but I don't know what I should say So can I just give you a hug?,2764
Indianapolis,Could I ask you to try to eat this chocolate? Sorry Portland went and made something stupid again and there's so much left over,2765
Indianapolis,I made this chocolate together with Norfolk. It's my first attempt at anything like this so I can't guarantee it'll be good But I hope you'll still give it a taste.,2765
Indianapolis,Um this year you're getting chocolate designed after my sister Why? She said something about wanting to see you and me together – me handing you my chocolate and you accepting it I'm not sure why but I don't see anything wrong with it I guess?,2766
Indianapolis,School life It's nice as long as you and my sister are here I think,2766
Indianapolis,"My sister makes great lunch boxes but she doesn't need to write ""I Love Indy"" on them every single time",2767
Indianapolis,I like this plushie Portland gave me But something about it feels off,2767
Indianapolis,I'm definitely better at science than languages How do I get better at expressing my feelings?,2768
Indianapolis, What? I'm not sleeping. Haven't I told you that I just have a slower reaction time than others?,2768
Indianapolis,Is this my reward for behaving?,2769
Indianapolis, It's time to go home already?,2769
Indianapolis,Really I-58? California rolls don't really count as sushi? Huh that's interesting. Thanks you learn something new every day,2770
Indianapolis,Here sis I got you some food. Now try to pipe down for a little while.,2770
Indianapolis,Oh right. I forgot when's the dance? Not yet? All right I can rest easy then.,2771
Indianapolis,My sis could use a dance partner. Who'd make a good candidate?,2771
Indianapolis,It looks like the party hasn't started yet.,2772
Indomitable,My Illustrious-class sisters are all outstanding. Should you run into any problems they would be more than glad to help Me? Um well I suppose I wouldn't mind offering you some advice,2772
Indomitable,Oh my an invitation to a tea party? Though I think I'll pass. Keeping up airs is soooo tiring.,2773
Indomitable,Sleep revitalizes the body daydreaming revitalizes the mind and strolling refreshes one's mood. I'll have you know all forms of relaxation serve a purpose and are DEFINITELY not slacking off.,2773
Indomitable,*Yaaawn* Can't get motivated right now Huh work? I've already finished all of it.,2774
Indomitable,Did you need something? Though it'd be great if you didn't,2774
Indomitable,Double my vacation time buy me some sweets and I'll keep this a secret. Hehe not such a bad deal right?,2775
Indomitable,Hyah?! Gosh how rude of you to interrupt my daydreaming!,2775
Indomitable,New missions huh Should be no problem at all for someone as experienced as you right?,2776
Indomitable,New mail? Are we being told to go on vacation? Huh what do you mean that's not possible?,2776
Indomitable,The commission team has returned. I shall await your return so you should go greet them soon.,2777
Indomitable,I've gotten stronger but maybe I shouldn't let anyone know that.,2777
Indomitable,M-me flagship? Sounds like a pain in the Err it's nothing! I'll do it!,2778
Indomitable,I'm the MVP? I wonder if I shouldn't have tried so hard,2778
Indomitable,Seems like I'll be in the docks for a good while Well don't threaten me with a good time I suppose.,2779
Indomitable,Maybe I should start to get serious,2779
Indomitable,If this drags on I'll seriously be in trouble,2780
Indomitable,*sigh* I knew I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up,2780
Indomitable,My hobbies? Hmm Honestly I haven't given it much thought up until this point. Let's see what I like isn't so much finding things to do but rather finding ways of not doing anything.,2781
Indomitable,Hehe I see you're also slack– Err I mean nourishing your body and soul. That pleases me greatly. Alright let's continue practicing the art of clearing our minds on a regular basis! As for where to conduct the lessons how about in my room?,2781
Indomitable,Should you run into any problems You should come to me first not my sisters Y-yeah I think I'm fine with that,2782
Indomitable,Did you sleep well yesterday? If you're tired you might want to take a little nap or go on a stroll outside first. I'll accompany you~,2782
Indomitable,Formidable won't let any of our other sisters see her cheeky side but she's a lot more open around me for whatever reason Well there's not a whole lot we have in common anyway. Her taste in music is a bit too noisy for my tastes.,2783
Indomitable,I'm serious. Y-you can come see me even if you don't have any problems,2783
Indomitable,You're such a bully,2784
Indomitable,The commission fleet seems to have come back. Hurry up and go– Err I mean let's go greet them together.,2784
Indomitable,If it's for your sake I suppose I can put in a bit more effort,2785
Indomitable,MVP huh Darn it now I'm going to have to rest up to get my motivation back!,2785
Indomitable,Don't worry I'm the type of girl who can bounce right back after a little nap.,2786
Indomitable,Let's see the next things to do on our date are chilling together indoors leisurely enjoying some tea then quietly arrange some flowers. Hm? You want to go outside? I I think our schedule's already pretty packed. Look every time we go outside on a date my legs get all puffy the next day,2786
Indomitable,Welcome back Master~ All righty that's all my maid-motivation used up,2787
Indomitable,Knowing how to brew tea is one of the essentials for the Royal Maids no? Well that's something even I can do. Though only once a day no more than that.,2787
Indomitable,What jobs am I capable of doing? Let's see Oh I can warm up the bed for you before you go to sleep?,2788
Indomitable,I'm sure someone with THIS many maids would live an absolutely blessed lifestyle Ugh it's making me jealous the more I think about it,2788
Indomitable,Are you trying to give me a massage? My shoulders were just starting to feel a bit stiff so massage away~,2789
Indomitable,I'm going to tell my sisters you know?,2789
Indomitable,The Royal Maids are always carrying all sorts of yummy snacks back and forth I wonder how they can control themselves.,2790
Ingraham,Breaking stuff is easy. Making stuff is not.,2790
Ingraham,Why am I wearing just one stocking? Uhh because I forgot to put the other one on. What does it matter anyway? Clothes are just a bother.,2791
Ingraham,There's a loose screw under the bookcase No biggie I'll get it myself. And don't you dare try to sneak a dirty peek in while I'm doing it.,2791
Ingraham,Keep the touching to a minimum thanks.,2792
Ingraham,This is your dirty-deeds-hand huh? I'm gonna keep you armlocked until you say you're sorry.,2792
Ingraham,This hairpin? It's made from a repurposed binder clip. Is that so weird?,2793
Ingraham,New missions huh? Ugh. I don't wanna get off my butt,2793
Ingraham,Need a pen to write the mission complete papers? Here you can borrow mine.,2794
Ingraham,Mail eh I could give your mailbox a makeover if you want.,2794
Ingraham,Commission complete. Any parts you don't need? Send 'em my way.,2795
Ingraham,Rigging upgrades huh? Keep them coming thanks.,2795
Ingraham,Full module calibration complete. I'm loaded and ready for battle!,2796
Ingraham,Sweet! My rigging's perfectly tuned!,2796
Ingraham,I've gotta do thorough rigging maintenance when I get back!,2797
Ingraham,Nothing personal!,2797
Ingraham,Oh crap! That's gonna be a pain to repair!,2798
Ingraham,I'd love to unscrew your thick skull and have a look at what's inside.,2798
Ingraham,Even minor flaws impact the quality of a product. You want high-end equipment? Make sure it's perfectly calibrated.,2799
Ingraham,"Hey Cooper I finished that ""morph item"" you asked about No Allen! Stop plastering stickers all over my stuff!",2799
Ingraham,Listen if you ever need something just hit me up. Scratch that uhh You can hit me up anytime for any reason. I just feel kinda lonely without you you know? Ahem Anyway!,2800
Ingraham,Here I thought you were dense but I guess I was wrong. Oh yeah I made this ring for you. It's no promise ring but I still want you to have it This thing's special to me so don't even think about having me remake it for you.,2800
Ingraham,Okay all systems green. Say hello to my new and improved Chocomaker 2.0. It makes decent chocolate but it's got nothing on my handmade stuff. Speaking of which how do you like it? Pretty good huh?,2801
Ingraham,You're on time for once! That means you're due for a reward. I'll make your drink doubly sweet.,2801
Ingraham,Your job's simple. All you need to do is drink what I serve you and give feedback on the taste mouthfeel et cetera.,2802
Ingraham,All I asked Allen for was some label paper and instead she dumped a billion different stickers on me,2802
Ingraham,No Cooper that stuff's got alcohol in it. Put it back where you found it.,2803
Ingraham,Yeah Allen made me wear this getup when she found out I'll be handling the bar counter That said I guess I don't really mind it.,2803
Ingraham,Hey! Wow Hope you like your lemonade with 30 times more lemon juice.,2804
Ingraham,Once I've perfected this recipe I'll give you a gold taste-tester medal for your efforts.,2804
Ingraham,Commission complete. Let's see if they brought back anything I can use,2805
Intrepid,Am I slated to sortie today? If not hurry up and fix that!,2805
Intrepid,One should always go all out no matter the enemy Having that said there are various practical reasons why that isn't always possible,2806
Intrepid,Despite the fact that there are many Essex-class carriers we all have our good spots you say? Uhh you're not talking about our ship performance? I've never given much thought to those bothersome things,2806
Intrepid,Want something to drink? Then how about a martini – shaken not stirred? Just kidding!,2807
Intrepid,You *sigh*I'm way more inclined to beat you to a pulp than to praise you for your bravery.,2807
Intrepid,Wooahh?! You're messing up my hair?!,2808
Intrepid,Having trouble with your missions? If you're stumped why don't you let me try my hand?,2808
Intrepid,Mission accomplished! See there's nothing you can't do if you put your mind to it!,2809
Intrepid,There's new mail do we have new orders?,2809
Intrepid,Phew I'm back! Oh you need a battle report repair and resupply overviews and a mission debriefing? Sure five minutes should be enough right? After that send me back out there!,2810
Intrepid,Flight preparations complete! Attack squadrons roll out!,2810
Intrepid,The crown of victory goes to me the one who knows no fear!,2811
Intrepid,I have to go to the docks again? Damnit why is it always me Y-you didn't hear anything!,2811
Intrepid,Let's get this done!,2812
Intrepid,Crap I didn't think there'd be so many of them,2812
Intrepid,The great symbol of fearlessness is none other than I – Intrepid! Don't you forget that!,2813
Intrepid,Happy Valentine's Day! I've been working hard with my friends to make great chocolate! For the sake of someone so important to all of us it's only appropriate that we all work together!,2813
Intrepid,Happy Valentine's Day! My goal this year was to see how well I could do all on my own! The skill power and raw bravery necessary to go it alone and rough it to the last are all necessary for me to stand side-by-side with you. And nooow Behold the result of it all!,2814
Intrepid,No matter how strong the enemy I have absolute confidence that you will be able to draw out my full power! Come on add me to the next sortie roster!,2814
Intrepid,I-I won't give in no matter how many times you attack!,2815
Intrepid,~,2815
Intrepid,Having trouble with your missions? Well let's work on 'em together!,2816
Intrepid,Mission accomplished! See two heads are better than one!,2816
Intrepid,It's not enough to just be a pitcher. I've gotta be a good batter as well! Oh Bluegill's also out there training. Let's grab her for our practice!,2817
Intrepid,Nice catch! You've got skill! How about becoming my catcher?,2817
Intrepid,A ponytail really does get in the way huh Next time maybe I'll try putting it up,2818
Intrepid,Gah! I threw the ball full power and lost control of it My bad my bad!,2818
Intrepid,All righty! This one's headed towards the ends of the universe! Wait how's the catcher gonna get it then,2819
Intrepid,Even if you brought protection getting hit by my fastball is gonna hurt like hell~,2819
Intrepid,Nobody can return one of my pitches!,2820
Intrepid,Gah I gave up a run,2820
Ise,We're fine without fuel. All you need out on the seas is some good food and booze!,2821
Ise,What should I call Fusou? Big sister? Senpai?,2821
Ise,Ise Shrine? I've seen it from a distance but they won't let me go in,2822
Ise,What? W-What do you mean an aviation battleship can't fly? Lame!,2822
Ise,I I'm coming too! Wait for me!,2823
Ise,Mmhmmm~! All I need is a beer and a raw egg to wake up. Do you want some too?,2823
Ise,Whoo! Just the thing to prop up the corner of the table!,2824
Ise,Operation Kita was more fun that this!,2824
Ise,A flight deck eh? I wish I could fly,2825
Ise,Finally! My turn to make some noise.,2825
Ise,Ahaha! As a super dreadnought it's only natural!,2826
Ise,One final bombardment!,2826
Ise,Super dreadnoughts open fire!!,2827
Ise,Are you from the Army?,2827
Ise,It'd be wonderful to be able to go stargazing with Hyuuga again.,2828
Ise,Thank you~! I'm going to stay by your side until the end of the end. Why? Because I hate drinking alone!,2828
Ise,My wine-filled chocolate have a special flavor to them It's not enough to get you drunk but it'll get you through the day at least! Ahahaha!,2829
Ise,"My initial plan for Valentine's was to go drinking with you and the girls again but then I wondered ""Wouldn't a 1-on-1 chat in a quiet bar be more cozy?"" and decided on that instead! By the way I've heard this place serves hot chocolate if you just ask for it.",2829
Ise,Damn Guess aviation battleships can't fly after all. Kinda let down honestly,2830
Ise,What? I can't let my aircraft fly around the port whenever I want? Why not?!,2830
Ise,You interested in my flight deck?,2831
Ise,Aviation battleships can't fly but if you want me to send you flying then I'll grant your wish.,2831
Ise,Keep an eye out? My aircraft can do that easy peasy. I tell ya these beauts are really handy~,2832
Isuzu,Torpedoes are truly frightening,2832
Isuzu,It feels creepy at night without any lights on don't you think?,2833
Isuzu,I've seen plenty of things in this world! You won't scare me so easily.,2833
Isuzu,Uwa! It's touching me! It's touching me!,2834
Isuzu,Mission rewards delivered! I wonder if there's anything good,2834
Isuzu,The girls have completed their commissions! I hope they didn't bring anything strange back,2835
Isuzu,Did I get stronger?,2835
Isuzu,Nothing weird is going to pop out right?,2836
Isuzu,*Cries*  Are they all demons?,2836
Isuzu,I I'm not scared!,2837
Isuzu,*Cries* Are ghosts scary because they don't exist in this world?,2837
Isuzu,Ah? A midnight adventure? That it's not a good idea is it? No I'm not afraid!,2838
Isuzu,*Cries* There definitely was something strange there just now! I already said a midnight adventure was a bad idea!,2838
Isuzu,I wasn't planning on doing anything for Valentine's Day but since you always treat us so well I figured it was appropriate to make something? S-so don't say you don't want it!,2839
Isuzu,My chocolate-making skills have improved as a result of my modernizing and retrofitting! After eating my chocolate ask my sister to cook for you as well when she has time! I want to make sure you eat properly!,2839
Isuzu,Whuah?! Y-you scared me there Don't just poke someone from behind when they're making chocolate! I'm making Abukuma's and Yura's too so I've got my hands full for today! As for your chocolate I made it well in advance so don't worry about that! Heh!,2840
Isuzu,Nagara always looks after me and wants to cook my food for me but I'm an adult! This tiny chocolate is proof that I am! Even after you've eaten everyone else's food you must have room for this right? My feelings are all jam-packed into that tiny package so make sure you taste it well!,2840
Isuzu,Y-you saw something weird?! Wh-wh-where?! Jeez! Don't scare me like that!,2841
Isuzu,Nagara said that I looked cuter before but I think that's just because she likes to dote on me!,2841
Isuzu,Kinu seems like the dependable type but she sometimes gives off really scary vibes Ugh I just don't understand her.,2842
Isuzu,The girls in the commission fleet have come back. Hopefully they didn't bring anything weird back with them?,2842
Isuzu,Leave the anti-air support to me!,2843
Isuzu,I I'm not afraid anymore!,2843
Isuzu,There's many monsters roaming around during Halloween B-but I'm not scared okay?!  Umm err uh Can I hold your hand?,2844
Isuzu,A-all those Halloween monsters are just people in costumes right?!  There aren't any real ones roaming around right?!,2844
Isuzu,Monsters aren't real Monsters aren't real M-m-monsters aren't real.!,2845
Isuzu,W-w-why do they make even the pumpkins look scary?!,2845
Isuzu,L-l-looks like everyone's enjoying Halloween I-I-I-I'm not shuddering okay?!,2846
Isuzu,*Eeek*?! I-I'll turn you into a frog!,2846
Isuzu,Two people sitting in front of the fireplace like this feels a bit like family.,2847
Isuzu,My sisters wanted to dress up as Santa Claus and go around handing presents to kids I didn't go with them because I'm not good with the dark.,2847
Isuzu,It's so cozy right next to the fireplace There are even fuzzy Manjuus to cuddle~,2848
Isuzu,Are you trying to share my body heat?,2848
Isuzu,I knew it! You were trying to take advantage of me!,2849
Isuzu,I was told that this outfit would be good for wearing around the house but it's a bit too loose S-stop staring at me already.,2849
Isuzu,Wooah! I fell down again But at least it's cooler now Huh? A photoshoot? Noo don't take a picture of me~,2850
Isuzu,I wasn't trying to spill the juice! Sorry,2850
Isuzu,I had no idea donning a mascot suit was so demanding Fubuki used to wear these all the time That's way too insane,2851
Isuzu,Haah I wonder if I should take a little breather It's so nice and cool,2851
Isuzu,Card games? N-no way that'd be way too hard,2852
Isuzu,Ugh I knew you'd take advantage of this opportunity to tease me,2852
Isuzu,Mascot outfits are so hard to move around in It's all dark and stuffy inside Ugh,2853
Izumo,Late as always. Just how long will you keep me waiting?,2853
Izumo,If you've got time to stare at me then maybe do your work instead.,2854
Izumo,A blade requires careful maintenance. Isn't that obvious?,2854
Izumo,Sisters eh. The Izumo class consists of just me so I guess I'm a bit jealous.,2855
Izumo, I-I'll slice your hand off!,2855
Izumo,What are you planning to do about these unfinished missions?,2856
Izumo,Mission complete Good lord would you ever have realized it on your own?,2856
Izumo,Here's a letter. It's rude to the sender to not read their letter thoroughly. Don't you agree?,2857
Izumo,Look who's back. Time's precious so start reflecting on your last sortie immediately.,2857
Izumo,Commission complete. Why don't you go on one yourself sometime?,2858
Izumo,My blade grows sharper.,2858
Izumo,All ships form up! Target: enemies in front!,2859
Izumo,Victory? Of course we won!,2859
Izumo,Damn I can still fight!,2860
Izumo,Feel the wrath of my blade!,2860
Izumo,P-put out the fire!,2861
Izumo,You lack what it takes to order me to swing this blade.,2861
Izumo,This blade is my other half. Casually touch it and you'll get hurt.,2862
Izumo,Hey you've started getting just a bit into shape recently Hmph I suppose I'll acknowledge you've worked hard.,2862
Izumo,The path of my blade is one of constant solitude or so I thought. Hmph maybe being with you isn't so bad after all.,2863
Izumo,You're making that miserable face again. I just can't leave you be huh Listen today is the day I will acknowledge your hard work or should I say your talent! I battleship Izumo swear on my blade to walk with you both in life and death.,2863
Izumo,My name has connections to classical dancing? I-I see,2864
Izumo,Dancing and my sword are much alike. Untold hours of learning and practice are for a single moment of brilliance,2864
Izumo,Savory delicacies and mature festivities I say why not enjoy the New Year and let loose for once? Hahahah!,2865
Izumo, Drunk? Me? I've only had a few *Hick*,2865
Izumo,I'll remind ya in case ya forgot! I'm the battleship Izumo!,2866
Izumo,How stunning; how gorgeous – to my eyes the sight of this battlefield is worth ten thousand ryo.,2866
Jamaica,Boss my Eye has seen it Your necktie is slightly loose.,2867
Jamaica,Boss can you check if these chains are covering my left eye? I'll reposition my arm.,2867
Jamaica,"Boss is the ""you"" that my Eye sees really ""you""?",2868

Jamaica,Victory comes to those who are determined! Stand Proud!,2875
Jamaica,Unfortunately Boss it seems your Goals differ from mine,2876
Jamaica,Boss care for a chat? There seems to be a need for us to Know one another.,2876
Jamaica,An age of justice? That is not what I want. Where there is light there is dark. Evil cannot be eradicated so easily Boss.,2877
Jamaica,You end up on the path of Evil if you only focus on your own justice your own desires. Never let the Darkness out of sight. I'm here with you Boss.,2877

Jamaica,Boss here's some chocolate we made for you Oh okay So you want three more of these sweet ones? Sure I can do it. Once more will all my heart I'll get to work!,2879
Jamaica,Boss after making this chocolate I've realised something. I can't pursue just the result. Because when all you want is the result you start to look for shortcuts. I think the most important thing in Valentine's chocolate is your sincerity!,2879
Jamaica,Hey Boss study this parfait from top to bottom. The chocolate flakes are premium quality. Then you have the jelly whipped cream ice cream and finally the crunchy granita When you eat this royalty among desserts you do it from the top using a spoon!,2880
Jamaica,Hey Boss you talkin' about my sweet bike? Heh I made it myself by scrounging up parts from Akashi's place. Pretty cool huh?,2880

Jamaica,Boss when I drive I like to go fast. When you're sitting behind me make sure to hold on tight!,2882
Jamaica,"Boss what if I named this bad boy here ""Dark Bolt?",2883
Jamaica,Boss do you wanna try riding too? Be careful this guy's got some serious horsepower.,2883
Jamaica,Boss even though I told you to hold on to me tight I didn't mean right there,2884
Jamaica,Boss come take a seat. We're gonna forget all about the the smoke of the battlefield and feel the wind at our side.,2884
Jamaica,I used to consider myself a drifter a vagabond with no home and no destination. But I learned that I was wrong Boss. No matter what happens I'll always come back to home.,2885
Jamaica,Look Boss this is the new bike that Akashi sent me. She said she wanted me to be her brand ambassador Doesn't that job sound badass?,2885
Jamaica,"Akashi said she'd give me this bike in exchange for some ""marketing."" Sooo Boss what do you think? Wanna buy one?",2886
Jamaica,This baby's got more horsepower than the other one even if it's less reliable. She's still a good bike.,2886
Jamaica,Worried about your hair? Well safety's the most important thing on the road so you'd better hang on to this helmet.,2887
Jamaica,Boss would you like to learn about motorcycles? I thought you might. Let's begin with starting the engine. First,2887
Jamaica,Do you hear it boss? The rumbling of her engine? She thirsts for the open road. What are you waiting for? Hop on! But don't forget your helmet.,2888
Jamaica,Boss the mountains are lovely this time of year. How about it?,2888
Jamaica,I once thought myself a traveler with nothing to tie me down with no real destination Turns out I was wrong Boss. I'll always come back to you no matter what happens.,2889

Jean_Bart,Go figure you're busier than I expected. If ya need a hand with something just gimme a shout.,2930
Jean_Bart,If some dumbass sticks their nose where it doesn't belong they got only themselves to blame when they're hanging from my cannons.,2931
Jean_Bart,The era of battleships is over? Hah the hell you mean? MY era is just getting started!,2931
Jean_Bart,Idiots just don't ever wisen up do they What drives 'em to pray to a made-up being that won't even respond?,2932
Jean_Bart,Stop trying to hit on me.,2932
Jean_Bart, You better not regret this later.,2933
Jean_Bart,A job's a job. Whining won't make it go away.,2933
Jean_Bart, Pish them's some shabby rewards.,2934

Jean_Bart,Don't bother with courtesy! Just bunch up and come at me!,2936
Jean_Bart,Your endeavors were touching but when you pick the wrong fight that's all they'll ever be.,2937
Jean_Bart,My payback comes with interest Before long you'll know how much!,2937
Jean_Bart,Playtime's over!,2938
Jean_Bart,That all ya got?,2938
Jean_Bart,Seems you've mistaken a wolf for a dog Hmph don't start crying if you get bit cause of it.,2939
Jean_Bart,Your smile makes me think of her She's someone I wanna hate but can't bring myself to.,2939
Jean_Bart,Stop looking so intimidated. Long as you won't betray me I won't betray you.,2940
Jean_Bart,I can't stand hearing those babies cry when you get hurt So use me as a shield. I don't mind.,2940
Jean_Bart,It's like the mood eases up when you're with me I'mma get some rest right here And don't you leave me,2941
Jean_Bart,The path I walk is an unforgiving dirt-ridden path where you can't even see the future lying ahead of you. But ya still wanna go with me?  Hmph your stupidity amazes me. And for your foolishness I offer you the rest of my days.,2941
Jean_Bart,I guess I ended up making my way to you. As kindred spirits let us spend the day quietly together. I guess that's not possible. Here I'll at least give you this chocolate.,2942
Jean_Bart,A bottle of wine? For me? Thanks. I've got something for you too. C'mon let's go to our little sanctuary and enjoy a quiet Valentine's Day together. Just the two of us.,2942
Jean_Bart,Zzz Ah shit I dozed off. Got caught up in the moment Or maybe your lap is just too cozy. You wanna switch? I don't mind spending the whole day like this if you're cool with that.,2943
Jean_Bart,Beautiful sights tasty food sweet chocolate Gotta say I don't mind just dining and hanging out with you once in a while. Got any plans by the way? Valentine's Day isn't over yet and I'm open to anything.,2943
Jean_Bart,Gimme that I'm gonna help ya out Of course I'm gonna assist I'm your secretary.,2944
Jean_Bart,I'm not the kinda girl who goes shopping with Dunkerque and Algérie. But you knew that already being the person who knows me best right? On the other hand I wouldn't mind doing that with you.,2944
Jean_Bart,I ain't letting any new talent outshine me. I am Jean Bart the Vichya Dominion's most powerful ship and bearer of the sacred Iris' name. This title is my pride and I will never surrender it.,2945
Jean_Bart,If you wanna go talk to Richelieu then I could come with ya. We believe in different things but we're still sisters.,2945
Jean_Bart,Praying isn't my thing but wishing is fine by me. 'Cause wishing for the wellbeing of the one you love is what it means to be human.,2946
Jean_Bart,Look just don't get too flirty with me,2946
Jean_Bart,You're really that keen on my body?,2947
Jean_Bart,This loot ain't nearly good enough. Not for me nor for you.,2947
Jean_Bart,I mighta once had a big role to play but with you in command I just never get to truly act.,2948
Jean_Bart,Guess that merrymaking team's come back.,2948
Jean_Bart,All hail the Vichya Dominion!,2949
Jean_Bart,Oh crap guess I dozed off. How 'bout you take a quick nap too? You could use my lap for a headrest. Take it easy. You and I we're always by each other's side.,2949
Jean_Bart,The guest of honor shouldn't be wandering around looking for girls drinking alone Hmph might as well have a drink while you're here anyway.,2950
Jean_Bart,I'm more willing to listen to Dunkerque than a lot of others. She's a lot more in touch with the masses.,2950
Jean_Bart,Letting go of everything and losing yourself to the merriment of song and dance that is what a banquet should be about. Not this pompous farce that makes even wine taste bad.,2951
Jean_Bart,The one thing that this banquet has going for it is the fact that everyone's smiles are genuine and heartfelt Look I'm praising you can't you tell?,2951
Jean_Bart,"Cheers Hmph. I never asked for the ""blessing"" of being someone's sister but I've already gotten used to what that entails.",2952
Jean_Bart,You still have missions to do even now?  Need my help?,2952
Jean_Bart,C'mon put all that stuff aside and have a drink with me.,2953
Jean_Bart,Did you just come back from battle? Here cheers.,2953
Jean_Bart,A commission fleet has returned? Let's head down to greet them together then. I needed some fresh air anyway.,2954
Jean_Bart,Mmm the wind on the battlefield now that's what I'm used to.,2954
Jean_Bart,Hmph. Still better than going to that banquet,2955
Jean_Bart,I loathe red tape nor do I have any desire to stand here like a flower vase for people to stare at But I'm doing all of this for you because you make me feel like it's all worth it. You've committed quite the serious offense mon amour,2955
Jean_Bart,You damn scalawag You don't just sneak into someone's hideaway without consequences ya know. Though I found this place by pure chance too. Don't go tellin' anyone else about it!,2956
Jean_Bart,Don't you go touchin' my stuff without permission! I'll knock ya out cold.,2956
Jean_Bart,You wanna go lookin' for treasure? There's no damn treasure 'round here. But one day Hmph one day when we've achieved a boring peace I'll give you a taste of what a real treasure hunt is like.,2957
Jean_Bart,Sorry but this hammock's only big enough for one of us. Ya wanna relax get your own. I ain't your personal servant.,2957
Jean_Bart,Just how much damn work do you have if you're even bringin' it up here? You just like being with me? Tsk,2958
Jean_Bart,Wha–? Is Is that Surcouf? The hell How'd she end up dozing off in here? That girl's a real piece of work.,2958
Jean_Bart,Ack! Don't put your damn ice-cold soda on me! You're on thin ice buddy,2959
Jean_Bart,You're not the only one who can do whatever ya want just 'cause nobody else will come here. I can too. Understand?,2959
Jean_Bart,Would you stop comin' here right after returning to port? Don't want people catching wind of this place and turning it into a playground.,2960
Jean_Bart,Man The sun's crazy bright out today What you're still here? How long are ya gonna hang around? Hmph you're real good both at making me happy AND making me mad you know that?,2960
Jean_Bart,"Bonne année Or rather I should say ""Happy New Year"" here yes? A year of peace and prosperity passes and we are here to welcome another and I must thank you for making that possible.",2961
Jean_Bart,Work same as always huh? Tell me if there's anything I oughta know.,2961
Jean_Bart,Aid with getting dressed? This is nothing compared to a ceremonial Iris dress. Not to mention it suits me better. Don't ya agree?,2962
Jean_Bart,Sakura Empire-style badminton? Sounds fun. I'll knock that shuttlecock beyond the horizon!,2962
Jean_Bart,I hate it when people approach me to either give or get a hug. Never asked for their damn compassion.,2963
Jean_Bart,Wagashi for me? Thanks. Dunkerque sure is considerate as always.,2963
Jean_Bart,What you wanna see me brandish one of these?,2964
Jean_Bart,Umph! What now?!,2964
Jean_Bart,Hmh,2965
Jean_Bart,You're back? Seems you've got girls queuein' up to meet you. Me not so much,2965
Jean_Bart,Forward! Quarter them!,2966
Jean_Bart,I'm not the type to underestimate anyone.,2966
Jean_Bart,Not to say I've grown soft but I have gotten too used to you bein' around. I don't mind it – hell I like it. I'm all but dependent on you that's just how important you are to me.,2967
Jenkins,There are actually some obvious differences between us Fletcher sisters.,2967
Jenkins,It really is a wonder that all of us who ended up spread across the world could reunite here,2968
Jenkins,That supply fleet Isn't the enemy this time around right?,2968
Jenkins,If only I was a little more brave,2969
Jenkins,Now is not the time for me to be scared L-let's give them a beating!,2969
Jenkins,Whew I was so nervous I thought my heart was going to burst H-hooray for victory!,2970
Jenkins,*Pant* *Pant* T-the enemy hasn't caught up yet have they?!,2970
Jenkins,I-if you don't run away now then I'll have to get serious!,2971
Jenkins,U-um Please stop staring at me!,2971
Jenkins,I'm a bit of a scaredy cat and I'm always afraid to tell people what I really think,2972
Jenkins,How about we have some tea together after lunch N-n-not like a date or anything like that!,2972
Jenkins,I was afraid of having to rush my chocolate-making the night before Valentine's so this year I made it ahead of time! H-how early you ask? About half a year. Is that *too* early?,2973
Jenkins,Happy Valentine's! H-here you go! I planned this gift since last year! Maybe that's a bit too early but that gave me time to incorporate references to trends from the whole year and that was fun Wh-what do you mean the trends have long since died?!,2973
Jenkins,Umm H-here you go. Happy Valentine's Day. H-how long did I work on this one? I'm not sure honestly It was all I could think about whenever I had time so Yeah,2974
Jenkins,I wonder if Radford would be happy to wake up to an apple in her present box M-Maybe I should give her some candy after all?,2974
Jenkins,Santa would be wearing a Santa hat and a beard like I am right?,2975
Jenkins,Nicholas is acting just the same as she would on any other day even though it's Christmas,2975
Jenkins,It's a shooting star! If you make a wish upon it before it disappears! Uh you want to know what I wished for? I-It's a secret!,2976
Jenkins,You know It's okay to come a b-bit closer?,2976
Jenkins,I won't hand these important presents over Hah!,2977
Jersey,Do you need anything? Or are you just here to chat?,2977
Jersey,I hate it when others underestimate me because of my size!,2978
Jersey,No one knows what's on a person's mind if they don't say it aloud. I do not like people who are roundabout.,2978
Jersey,"I wish you would compliment me for being honest rather than for being ""cute."" Not that I mind compliments like that.",2979
Jersey,What you want to nuzzle against my lap? You can keep your fantasies in your dreams where they belong.,2979
Jersey,Stop pretending like you haven't seen the new missions and get them done already.,2980
Jersey,Don't overexert yourself after returning from the battlefield. Relax.,2980
Jersey,I will not let your efforts go to waste.,2981
Jersey,We must face our enemies seriously no matter who they are.,2981
Jersey,This is the might of the J class! Regret your own carelessness!,2982
Jersey,Ugh You will pay dearly for staining my dress! Know this!,2982
Jersey,Now's not the time to be taking it easy!,2983
Jersey,You are a halfhearted and lousy individual.,2983
Jersey,There is one thing I want to set straight with you; I'm not foul-mouthed I simply say what's on my mind. For instance do you have a thing for little children?,2984
Jersey,But that's all right. You may fancy me if you like but if you don't then it's not *not* a problem,2984
Jersey,Now that I think about it we've been so straightforward that we've not even done anything romantic But now at least we know each other better than anyone else. I say we let romance into our lives starting today.,2985
Jersey,Good morning! I knew you were looking forward to receiving my chocolate so you're getting it right now first thing in the morning. No point wasting time and coming across as indecisive is there? Here. Hope this motivates you to excel at work today!,2985
Jervis,I wonder if it is an acceptable thing to keep your secretary waiting like this.,2986
Jervis,I don't want any harm to come to Janus. Please take good care of her and don't try to take advantage of her kindness.,2986
Jervis,Your nose is practically buried in your paperwork. If you don't want to live in a blurry world I'd advise you to be mindful of your posture.,2987
Jervis,"When treating people the emphasis should always be on the ""people"" part. Administering the port operates on the same principle. Though it's fine to be absorbed in your work try not to neglect the people around you.",2987
Jervis,Did Janus say anything weird to you lately? Nevermind. She's a kind-hearted girl but sometimes acts without thinking. It can be a bit of a pain sometimes,2988
Jervis,Let me see your hand. Good there's nothing wrong with it.,2988
Jervis,"Surely you're not going to say that was an ""accident"" are you?",2989
Jervis,What are you doing may I ask?,2989
Jervis,Leaving work unfinished is like allowing an illness to go untreated. By the time things get unmanageable it may already be too late. *sigh* Why do people choose to be so irresponsible anyway?,2990
Jervis,Mission complete. Don't forget to look back on your work to see if there's room for improvement.,2990
Jervis,New mail has arrived. If you miss any response deadlines I can't help you with that.,2991
Jervis,Welcome back–– Oh my you have some scratches on you. You shouldn't be so careless as to put yourself in danger I'll treat you right now so please stay still.,2991
Jervis,The commission's done. Make sure to wash your hands after carrying things or else our next meeting might be in the infirmary.,2992
Jervis,I do wonder if you're improving yourself while everyone else is getting stronger.,2992
Jervis,Remember to mind your safety even when you're fighting.,2993
Jervis,Is anyone injured? Please allow me to administer some basic treatment.,2993
Jervis,Careful now.,2994
Jervis,Nothing some emergency treatment can't fix!,2994
Jervis,Try not to get yourself hurt when you're out on sortie. It's going to be a huge headache for me if you end up bedridden.,2995
Jervis,Of course it falls upon me to look after you should you get injured And while that's rather troublesome for some reason I do find that prospect quite appealing I wonder if I'm coming down with some weird illness myself,2995
Jervis,"Seeing as how you aren't a complete plank I suppose I can give you an answer. Taking care of you isn't something I can't handle Huh? You want me to say ""I love you?"" Y-you idiot Maybe we can save that for next time",2996
Jervis,Please try to curb your bad habits for the sake of your health. I'll keep an eye on you for however long it takes until all traces of them are gone.,2996
Jervis,You idiot,2997
Jervis,You just can't resist doing perverted things can you?,2997
Jervis,You have a bunch of unfinished missions. Remember what I *sigh* Reminding you about everything has become a habit of mine.,2998
Jervis,Oh you completed a mission? Nicely done. You've proven your ability to commit to your duties.,2998
Jervis,You've received a new letter. Unless you have more urgent business I advise you read it now.,2999
Jervis,Look at you – you got hurt again! I'll have to use antiseptic. It's going to sting but you have only yourself to blame for that.,2999
Jervis,Is that all of the commission supplies? All right now it's time to wash your hands. Go on – put them forth and I'll show you how it's done.,3000
Jervis,The best type of victory is one without casualties.,3000
Jervis,Could you come see me again later today? No not for a checkup but rather for a d-da– Look you already know what I'm talking about. If you're interested then just say it please Y-you idiot,3001
Jervis,I thought a certain someone came here to slack off but turns out they had spare time and wanted to help out huh I guess there's nothing stopping you.,3001
Jervis,I'm helping out because the Maid Team is somewhat understaffed right now. What about my outfit? Is there something wrong about wearing maid attire while performing maid duties?,3002
Jervis,"Janus went to participate in the ""Maid Experience Day."" A real hard worker I tell you. If she runs into any problems won't you quietly lend her a hand? But don't bring me up at all.",3002
Jervis,Are you seriously going to stay here until lunch? I'm telling you now I only cook for my patients. If you're fine with that you're free to do as you please.,3003
Jervis,Huh?! Why'd the wind suddenly kick up?! Phew that was a close one Maybe I should just have you keep an eye on this for me? Just in case~,3003
Jervis,I'll be fine. I can still reach. More importantly where have your eyes been wandering?,3004
Jervis,Seems like the sheets aren't the only things that need cleaning. Let's put that dirty mind of yours through the wash too.,3004
Jervis,Since you have nothing better to do why don't you lend a hand and help me hang up the rest of these sheets? Surely you didn't come here just to watch me work?,3005
Jervis,As a maid I am able to take care of you even when you are not ill yes? Not that I care though. I'm not interested in becoming your maid; it was merely a thought experiment Yes nothing more than that.,3005
Jintsuu,If being cautious is considered cowardice then shouldn't being brave also be considered recklessness?,3006
Jintsuu,There is no single solution for everything. Only through comparison practice and even failure can one find their own correct answer.,3006
Jintsuu,What's the matter? I'm just thinking about how to manage the fleet.,3007
Jintsuu,Your new missions have been sorted. Please take a look.,3007
Jintsuu,Rewards are here Hmm? Don't worry. I'm just thinking about how to make our fleet more efficient.,3008
Jintsuu,Stop daydreaming! Commissions have returned!,3008
Jintsuu,Should we consider advancing deeper into enemy territory?,3009
Jintsuu,All ships charge forward!,3009
Jintsuu,Is that it?,3010
Jintsuu,All ships retreat! Do not make meaningless sacrifices.,3010
Jintsuu,I've been waiting for this moment!,3011
Jintsuu,You might as well just leave the fleet management to me.,3011
Jintsuu,I was a flagship before but now I'm just a common warrior. Please treat me the same as you would the others.,3012
Jintsuu,Real leaders will always stick to their guns no matter who opposes them. You can tell if their methods are correct by seeing who is willing to follow them. For example me,3012
Jintsuu,Making chocolate by yourself is simple but when three people try to do it together the difficulty jumps up a whole lot. After all you have to consider the strengths and personalities of everyone involved Though I feel like I've done a good job with that this time. Please enjoy this Sendai-class chocolate. Hehe~,3013
Jintsuu,Every now and then I get a bit jealous of Sendai and how straightforward she is,3013
Jintsuu,Even though some people may think that cautiousness is a sign of weakness I'll be happy as long as our fleet truly understands me,3014
Jintsuu,There's nothing wrong with wanting to see me dance I'll show you but only if you work seriously first!,3014
Jintsuu,Rewards have been issued! Want to see something interesting now that we can take it easy?,3015
Jintsuu,I can always work harder for the fleet!,3015
Jintsuu,Everyone get ready!  Press forward!,3016
Jintsuu,I only gave the orders the real credit goes to the fleet!,3016
Jintsuu,After we finish work today how about taking a break on the beach?,3017
Jintsuu,I said I was taking a vacation but even out here on the beach I'm still thinking about the affairs of the fleet I really am a workaholic aren't I?,3017
Jintsuu,If you relax too much you'll become undisciplined. If you're too uptight you'll only find yourself out of breath.,3018
Jintsuu,You can't concentrate on your work when I'm wearing a swimsuit right? Hehe just consider this a test of will then.,3018
Jintsuu,Here iced coconut water. Please have some.,3019
Jintsuu,Even in fairytale-esque stories there are hints of deception and trickery hidden throughout. Basically make sure to stay on guard as you usually doHehehe,3019
Jintsuu,If you think about it the Big Bad Wolf's plan has so many holes in it. For example he could have left the grandmother alive and used her as bait Ehehe I'm just playing around.,3020
Jintsuu,The moment you plan on striking down your prey is the moment you should be most alert. One can never know when a hunter might try to use the opportunity for their own benefit.,3020
Jintsuu,Speaking of hunters none are better suited for the role than Sendai. I really wouldn't want to make an enemy out of her even if it's just an act.,3021
Jintsuu,This outfit? Oh it's what I have on before I turn into the grandmother.,3021
Jintsuu,And checkmate. Hehehe~,3022
Jintsuu,Well done. I'll evaluate your battle plans for you just like you evaluated my acting skills for me.,3022
Jintsuu,Maybe I should gobble you right up.,3023
Joffre,Done with your morning prayers already? My apologies. Asking that of you is rather inappropriate on my part.,3023
Joffre,Bringing down punishment upon sinners—that is the sole reason for my existence. As for whether you will need to be judged or not it is still too early to tell.,3024
Joffre,Because I am one who judges sinners in a sense I hate everyone. All humans are born sinners after all.,3024
Joffre,Why did you stop working? If I'm not mistaken you still have missions to take care of?,3025
Joffre,I am not here to judge whether your actions are good or evil. Rather I am here to judge your existence itself.,3025
Joffre,Is something the matter?,3026
Joffre,Accept my judgment.,3026
Joffre,Your missions have arrived. Whether or not I pass judgment upon you depends on your progress.,3027
Joffre,The rewards for your missions are here. Take them without succumbing to greed.,3027
Joffre,It seems there's some new mail for you. Let's go check on it.,3028
Joffre,I shall judge the results of your battles on behalf of the Holy Iris. Well done. That was a magnificent victory.,3028
Joffre,The commission fleet has returned. Such is the Holy Iris's will.,3029
Joffre,As the Holy Iris wills.,3029
Joffre,In the name of the Vichya I shall bring down punishment upon thee.,3030
Joffre,It is time for you to repent. Your life shall continue no longer. Soon your remains shall become the foundations for our victory.,3030
Joffre,This is merely a trial under the guise of defeat,3031
Joffre,I deem thee Guilty!,3031
Joffre,So long as my wings don't break!,3032
Joffre,"Please don't force me to carry out my ""duties"" upon you. That would only make everyone sad.",3032
Joffre,"My duty here is to ""battle"" not to judge right? Do not worry. I shan't do anything that causes you worry.",3033
Joffre,My duty here isn't solely to battle but also to get along with the others at the port? Understood. If those are your orders as the leader of this port then I shall see them done.,3033
Joffre,"Don't just try to get along with the others but also try to have fun? But for me having fun means doing my ""other"" job Heh just kidding. I had fun watching your reaction just now. Ehehe.",3034
Joffre,I swear upon the name of the Holy Iris that our vows shall hold us together evermore. And with that I am no longer fit to pass judgment upon you but that's just fine with me. I'll just have to make good use of my newly-acquired qualification to love you instead. Hehehe.,3034
Joffre,The Holy Iris upholds Valentine's Day as a day for those in love. It's a day for lovers to be a bit more romantic than ordinary – which is to say it's a wonderful day. If you try to make a move on me I will be understanding. Heehee.,3035
Joffre,Are you curious about the Sacrament of Love? Of course I don't mind sharing with you—In order to make it easier for you to understand why don't we go on a date?,3035
Joffre,The Independence-class I don't think those girls understand the Holy Iris's will but they sure fight well.,3036
Joffre,While I may no longer hold the qualification to pass judgment upon you I am still qualified to continue observing your actions. That's the duty of a secretary ship after all. Hehehe.,3036
Joffre,What is it? Did you need something from me?,3037
Joffre,Hehehe,3037
Joffre,Whether or not I pass judgment upon you depends on your progress Just kidding of course. Let's work at a reasonable pace.,3038
Joffre,There is no need to fret. I am very well aware that all your battles are magnificent. What need is there for me to pass judgment?,3038
Joffre,Accept this divine punishment.,3039
Joffre,Were you planning on freeing me from this spell? Then I suppose you're prepared to lock lips with me. Even though I'm already awake um that's just part of the ritual.,3039
Joffre,Welcome back. What role will you be playing today? A dwarf? Or are you my prince in shining armor?,3040
Joffre,If I end up being hunted down I'll fight back with all I've got. That's the best way of ensuring my survival.,3040
Joffre,I won't drop dead from eating a poisoned apple or two. Unlike you I'm built pretty tough.,3041
Joffre,"Seven dwarves""Hmm. Why don't we ask the Manjuus to play that part?",3041
Joffre,You know I never expected Algérie to play a part like that. Though I didn't expect to be playing the role of a princess either.,3042
Joffre,You want to be my prince? That's fine with me.,3042
Joffre,You're acting just like a famished wolf right now hehehe.,3043
Joffre,We've received a new mission. How should we proceed?,3043
Joffre,My little mirror told me that you'd be arriving shortly. Hehe that's a joke of course.,3044
Joffre,Do you feel refreshed? Even without a holy ritual the Iris would be happy to know that I've managed to soothe you with this bath. Was it not enough? Then Shall we go back in?,3044
Joffre,Welcome back. Why don't you cleanse yourself before going to your office?,3045
Joffre,Am I having fun? Yes I'm quite enjoying this relaxation and the thought of crushing our enemies. What about you? Are you enjoying yourself?,3045
Joffre,Don't fret over my wings. The sacred symbols made manifest by the Sacraments are cleansed not with water but with one's faithful heart.,3046
Joffre,As long as I am here you won't commit the great sin of peeping. Though I wish it was thanks to your own restraint instead of my surveillance,3046
Joffre,I hear that a hot spring amidst the extreme cold elicits more gratitude than one amidst heat. Perhaps pleasure that takes advantage of one's weaknesses is the most terrifying of all.,3047
Joffre,Phew Praise unto the Iris for leading me to this wonderful bath.,3047
Joffre,Heehee. Is a steamy bath not enough to satisfy you?,3048
Joffre,La Galissonnière was kind enough to deliver your new mail. Would you like me to hold on to it for now?,3048
Joffre,Loath though I am I shall bare my skin too. Just as with the Holy See's edicts the rules of the bathhouse must also be upheld.,3049
Joffre,The commission team has returned. Shall we take hot springs souvenirs to them as thanks?,3049
Joffre,Things seem to have warmed up a bit. Good.,3050
Juneau,I want to be brave But it's really hard,3050
Juneau,please be gentle I'm very susceptible to pain,3051
Juneau,What? A mission? I don't mind as long as we aren't fighting submarines,3051
Juneau,I don't need any rewards just being here with everyone is enough for me,3052
Juneau,I'm really hoping this war will end soon Once it's over let's all go someplace together,3052
Juneau,I'll try to work harder!,3053
Juneau,Phew I almost got hit *Sob* I don't care about being the MVP I'm just trying my best so I can come home in one piece,3053
Juneau,Me too! I-I'll give it my best shot!,3054
Juneau,I'll need some getting used to my improved gear but I swear I won't be a liability!,3054
Juneau,Seeing how the rest of the fleet fights gives me goosebumps I hope I can be like them one day!,3055
Juneau,San Diego is leagues better than me despite being my little sister No I can't think that way! I have to keep working at it!,3055
Juneau,Is this a reward for the work I've done? Aww thank you!,3056
Juneau,Eep! P-please be gentle with me,3056
Juneau,I'll probably be fine even if submarines show up,3057
Juneau,This swan is so soft and pettable Heehee it even let me put a ribbon on it. Now we have matching looks Huh? You could take a picture of us? I-if it's not too much work then please by all means!,3057
Juneau,Having seen your gentle side and petted these swans it feels like my scaredy-cat self is no longer you know? Heehee.,3058
Juneau,Thank you for telling me I look good in this! San Juan really deserves credit for helping me get through my anxiety preparing for this date including picking out this dress.,3058
Juneau,Not only do I get the date of my dreams but I also get to be in a picture just with you I'm an extremely lucky person aren't I? Aw gosh,3059
Juneau,Aren't these frills pretty? I really like them too,3059
Juneau,That's quite a lot of mission rewards! This should be enough to buy gifts for San Diego and my friends.,3060
Juneau,I'll do everything I can to make these peaceful days last forever!,3060
Juneau,Heehee. The swan is happy for us.,3061
Juno,Uh that it looks like Jersey wants to play with me,3061
Juno,What! Pasta? Th-There's none. Can I decline?,3062
Juno,I wonder what the rewards are They must be nice!,3062
Juno,I didn't cause anyone any trouble did I?,3063
Juno,This isn't good after all,3063
Juno,Um That Juno giving her all!,3064
Juno,This crown? It's just a decoration. But if I'm Princess Juno will will you be my prince?,3064
Juno,An in-inspection now? Um I had a little too much to eat at the festival Awawa! N-nevermind!,3065
Juno,Umm next time we should invite Javelin to the festival I'm sure she'll make things even more lively.,3065
Juno,This festival has reminded me of how wonderful the Sakura Empire is. There's even so much good food~,3066
Junyou,That was a rich full day. Now how about we go on a date somewhere?,3066
Junyou,I trust you brought my favorite just ❀like always❀?,3067
Junyou,Hmph those girls need to learn to read the room,3067
Junyou,My planes too,3068
Junyou,The Marianas? I really don't like it there,3068
Junyou,Our first time together? I know it was ❀back then❀ but how could you not remember?,3069
Junyou,No! There's nothing wrong with me! I'm not sick! I'm not! It's just everyone else why don't you remember!,3069
Jupiter,Ju-Juno you don't need to be concerned about me I've been in this longer than you,3070
Jupiter,I sank I-60? That's not,3070
Jupiter,"My name is ""Jupiter"" not ""Cupider""",3071
Jupiter,I hope I'll get to come home some day,3071
Jupiter,Do we really have to do this,3072
Jupiter,Don't worry Juno. The mission has been completed.,3072
Jupiter,Our resources have increased,3073
Jupiter,I feel like something's changed,3073
Jupiter,This is God's judgement Hehehe,3074
Jupiter,I wasn't expecting this,3074
Jupiter,A-are we retreating?,3075
Jupiter,P-please don't dodge this,3075
Jupiter,I'll be fine on my own,3076
Jupiter,I made these chocolates with Juno's help Um I couldn't do it myself sorry,3076
Jupiter,Please um have my Valentine's chocolate I asked Juno for some ideas and settled on dark chocolate. It's It's supposed to be good for your health so,3077
Jupiter,My torpedo pillow? Hugging it makes me feel very safe,3077
Jupiter,I heard a rumor that a certain Ghost of the Eagle Union and a Demon from the Sakura Empire are interested in this show too.,3078
Jupiter,Eek! You you scared me,3078
Jupiter,You're just in time. The show hasn't started yet,3079
Kaga_(Battleship),Getting stronger isn't a spectator sport. Let me at 'em already!,3079
Kaga_(Battleship),"Those puny carrier aircraft are ""strong?"" Nonsense. What's more isn't it utterly insipid to fight without your own two hands?",3080
Kaga_(Battleship),Amagi is a worthy rival and the one who I respect the most. Even if you asked me to be her support I would have no objections.,3080
Kaga_(Battleship), Let me get a shot in first if you're going to do that!,3081
Kaga_(Battleship),Missions? If it's not combat-related don't come looking for me.,3081
Kaga_(Battleship),Mission rewards are here huh? I'll go grab 'em. I could use a bit of exercise.,3082
Kaga_(Battleship),Catch it's your mail.,3082
Kaga_(Battleship),Nothing is more exciting than defeating a strong enemy don't you think?,3083
Kaga_(Battleship),A commission has been completed. Speaking of commissions are they any fun? I'd like to give 'em a try.,3083
Kaga_(Battleship),Ahaha! I won't disappoint you!,3084
Kaga_(Battleship),A strong enemy? I'm looking forward to it. Don't let me down!,3084
Kaga_(Battleship),Too weak! Come back and face me again once you've had some more training.,3085
Kaga_(Battleship),Kuh! I'll remember your face,3085
Kaga_(Battleship),Only the strong have the right to stand on the battlefield!,3086
Kaga_(Battleship),Not bad! You are worthy of facing my full power!,3086
Kaga_(Battleship),You aren't one of the strong that I seek.,3087
Kaga_(Battleship),Realize your weakness is nothing to be ashamed of as long as you work hard to become stronger.,3087
Kaga_(Battleship),Why do I wish to become stronger? Does that really require a reason? If I had to choose it would be to defeat Amagi.,3088
Kaga_(Battleship),I sometimes feel like I can only become stronger through following your commands Hehe it's not a bad feeling though.,3088
Kaga_(Battleship),To be able to trust someone who always has my back to be able to fight without reservation this has always been my dream! And for that someone to be you what more could I ask for?,3089
Kaga_(Battleship),I cannot believe she convinced me to take part in this bizarre holiday Here just take it What are you talking about? There is nobody else for me to give this to!,3089
Kaga_(Battleship),"That ""sister"" is giving you trouble huh? Heh. That you can handle this so well really shows how gifted you are. Whether it's chocolate making or fleet management you've got a lot on your plate.",3090
Kaga_(Battleship),Here chocolate. Whether you take it now or later doesn't matter but you can't put it off forever. Got it? Good I've waited long for this day. Try it all you want but you're not getting off the hook. Hahahaha!,3090
Kaga_(Battleship),Here's your Valentine's chocolate. I do like making chocolate with my sister though I can't say the same about her simplistic approach to this whole holiday. It's true we both fancy you but only one of us will relentlessly pursue you – me. Remember that.,3091
Kaga_(Battleship),Heehee My prey has finally fallen right into my waiting hands so I hope you don't think I plan to let go You and I are going to spend a nice long day together. Call it a date if you'd like; either way you're stuck with me.,3091
Kaga,Justice and righteousness are for the strong only. The weak can only weep in vain.,3092
Kaga,I shall conquer all no matter who stands against me.,3092
Kaga,Our enemies may be strong but that is what makes them worth crushing. Heheh,3093
Kaga,Is there a problem?,3093
Kaga, Fine. If you say it helps you relax,3094
Kaga,Here are the rewards the fruits of your labor.,3094
Kaga,Your mail is here. Try not to forget it next time.,3095
Kaga,A fitting reward for the ears of our enemies. Let us enjoy the spoils of war leisurely.,3095
Kaga,The girls on commission have returned. Go on ahead I will prepare some refreshments for them.,3096
Kaga,Not bad. I’ve come up with some new combat techniques.,3096
Kaga,Entertain me with your final struggles. Hehehe,3097
Kaga,Such is the fate of the weak. Death nothing more.,3097
Kaga,This pain I shall return it tenfold!,3098
Kaga,Only the strong may survive on the battlefield!,3098
Kaga,It’s time for a death match! Heheh- hehehe!,3099
Kaga,It seems like you're not the hero I was looking for,3099
Kaga,The weak will be eliminated. If you cannot accept that then simply become stronger.,3100
Kaga,Should you be defeated one day it simply means that you were too weak. That much is a fact of nature. Though because you are mine I would at least avenge you.,3100
Kaga,I cannot comprehend these emotions is this some sort of primal instinct?,3101
Kaga,I have so much I want to say but I forget them all the moment I see your face,3101
Kaga, Is this for me? Hm perhaps it is fate for the strong to be drawn to each other. If that is the case I shall follow my instincts then. Hehehe~,3102
Kaga,When I think of giving chocolate to you I feel a strange uplifting sensation I don't get it Anyway here is my Valentine's present. Please accept it.,3102
Kaga,Take it. It's chocolate I made for you. While there's no way I can make you understand the passions brewing in my heart I'm afraid if you don't eat this chocolate Heh heh then I'll just have to eat you. Hahahaha,3103
Kaga,Here chocolate. Whether you take it now or later doesn't matter but you can't put it off forever. Got it? Good You've heard I assume? About how I never let someone go once I've set my sights on them.,3103
Kaga,Here's your Valentine's chocolate. You don't have to eat it at once – I've got a nuisance to deal with. Tosa. Don't ask any questions all you need know is my feelings for you are still the same. Unless you prompt a change of heart that makes me devour you right here and now. Hehehe,3104
Kaga,To hold one's hand and grow old together with him If it is to be with you then it won't so bad.,3104
Kaga,Heh Let's crush our foes together shall we?,3105
Kaga,Your expression exactly the same as Romeo when he lost himself in front of Juliet.,3105
Kaga,Wearing this dress makes me feel different it’s kind of strange,3106
Kaga,It seems quite interesting to imagine a little about our future.,3106
Kaga,It is natural for the strong to be attracted to one another lean close to me and do what you like.,3107
Kaga,You really like to touch me here don’t you?,3107
Kaga,On occasion it is surprisingly fun for me to cook. We’ll eat after you take a short break.,3108
Kaga,Hehe raise your head high and walk proudly with me. This is something to brag about isn't it?,3108
Kaga,Survival of the fittest,3109
Kaga,No matter where I am there is no end to war.,3109
Kaga,If I sent these rewards to Akagi instead I’m sure she would be pleased.,3110
Kaga,The commission fleet appears to have returned. Sister shall we go greet them?,3110
Kaga,Heh No matter what I wear my strength does not change.,3111
Kaga,Since it's the New Year you could probably afford to rest a little. I wouldn't mind.,3111
Kaga,Akagi your eyes make you seem like you're hunting for prey,3112
Kaga,Forgetting about war and just enjoying the holidays this isn't so bad every once in a while.,3112
Kaga,Preparing for the New Year sure requires a lot of stuff,3113
Kaga,It's time for the star of tonight's show huh? Don't worry I'll cover for you even if you mess up.,3113
Kaga,Have you finished making your rounds? As I said we can always catch up later. There are many others who are still waiting for your words But since you're already here might as well take a break if you want a change of pace.,3114
Kaga,The weak shouldn't push past their limits. You certainly don't want to end up like Yorktown over there.,3114
Kaga,It's not that I don't want to attend the party. If I'm to keep tabs on everything going on this is the best place to do that from.,3115
Kaga,You wanna kill some time? Hmph. Very well how about a round of chess then? I've been wanting to see how your powers have developed Hehehe,3115
Kaga,It's just a little hot,3116
Kaga,Hm?,3116
Kaga,Here. I've brought your mail.,3117
Kaga,A victory huh? As Akagi's as my sister's partner anything less would render you unfit for that honor.,3117
Kaga,The girls of the commission fleet have returned. Shall I bring some refreshments out to them?,3118
Kaga,1st CarDiv Kaga weighing anchor!,3118
Kaga,This is the judgment exacted upon the weak by the strong. Live on so that you may forever choke on the bitterness of defeat!,3119
Kaga,I never thought you'd end up taking such a long trip with me just to pick up a dress Though I'm worried about leaving my sister behind at port I suppose I should take your advice and relax a bit.,3119
Kaga,What are you doing up here?! Oh it's you. I thought you went to see my sister? You needed a breath of fresh air? That's all fine but you should return to my sister soon before she does something mad.,3120
Kagerou,Where am I from and where will I go Terribly difficult questions indeed.,3120
Kagerou,Grr~! Do not look at me so impudently! You're making me angry!,3121
Kagerou,I'm bored~ I feel like going on a trip with my sisters,3121
Kagerou,Hahahah~ You should take some time to properly reflect on your battles today~,3122
Kagerou,Have you a need for me?,3122
Kagerou,Missions are good milestones of growth. You should thoroughly check how much you've grown.,3123
Kagerou,Rewards are the proof one is working hard. Here I brought them for you.,3123
Kagerou,Mail is a bond. A bond which gives people power. You should pay heed to it.,3124
Kagerou,There is no need to rush things just take a quick break.,3124
Kagerou,There's still room for me to get stronger!,3125
Kagerou,At long last it's my turn!,3125
Kagerou,Phew! Now this is a victory! One worthy of adding as a decoration to my combat history!,3126
Kagerou,What a disgrace! I will not forget this!,3126
Kagerou,Light itself will bend before me!,3127
Kagerou,I have no desire to see you anymore! Go away!,3127
Kagerou,Light bending before your eyes - a heat haze is what my name means but it could also refer to an illusion However I am most certainly here! I am not an illusion!,3128
Kagerou,Although I lack any outstanding abilities I can confidently say I will be outdone by none other! How so you say? Hoho because I am the one and only Kagerou!,3128
Kagerou,I thought we would only become close enough to bump fists I never thought our relationship would develop to the point we could talk while holding each other's hands Life really is unpredictable. But I'm fine with that,3129
Kagerou,"You wish to march together with me?  What an outrageous question! You should already know what I think! My answer of course is ""yes""!",3129
Kagerou,Does this year's chocolate look like I made it with Shiranui's help again? Hah! Who knew not letting you see the process would come in handy like this? Naive one you should know that I can make this without relying on Shiranui!,3130
Kagerou,I'm working hard so that my sisters may eat the most delicious pumpkin around!,3130
Kagerou,A cannonball this is not it is a will-o'-wisp!,3131
Kagerou,I will cover my smokestack with this pumpkin then Ooh! Smoke is coming out of the pumpkin! Wait what is that smell Oh no! I burned the pumpkin!,3131
Kako,Good timing I just finished sorting your documents. Can you actually finish these?,3132
Kako,If you want to say something just give it to me straight!,3132
Kako,You made a mistake here. And here. Do I have to tell you how to do everything?,3133
Kako,I wonder how Aoba is doing right now,3133
Kako,Are you an idiot?,3134
Kako,Why you little Hello? Could I speak with the Military Police?,3134
Kako,So you can work hard as well huh? Here are the rewards.,3135
Kako,Mail's here. I'm surprised you have so many friends.,3135
Kako,Taking a break? Well since you put in your fair share of work why don't you set the rest of these files aside for later?,3136
Kako,The commission fleet has returned. Do you plan to sit here and wait for them to bring the resources to you?,3136
Kako,I suppose I should thank you for this.,3137
Kako,In any case I shall set the standard for heavy cruisers!,3137
Kako,To think that you could do this much I suppose I can offer you a word of praise.,3138
Kako,Tsk Can't you work a bit harder?,3138
Kako,Let me show my true strength!,3139
Kako,It seems that you'll never be able to earn my respect.,3139
Kako,To make this pose put your hands here What? You're embarrassed by me touching you? I'm blushing? Wh-what nonsense!,3140
Kako,You still have a long way to go but I suppose you're doing well for now Just how long do you plan to cling to me anyway? How despicable it seems like you haven't learned anything yet.,3140
Kako,You've been learning quickly lately About that hm If you want to experiment with me I'm ready.,3141
Kako,You've passed but just barely! This is only the beginning there's still a long way to go! What about me? If you want to spend the rest of your life with me I'm ready!,3141
Kako,Please accept these chocolates from me and Furutaka. I'd just like to point out that I'm not forcing Furutaka to do this with me. If anything Furutaka's the one who's the one F-Forget I said anything!,3142
Kako,You said you wanted chocolate made entirely by me without Furutaka's aid yes? I believe it came out rather plain but you're free to eat it all the same. It's odd giving you chocolate without Furutaka around But being alone with you is nice too.,3142
Kako,What do you want? Surely you didn't come to get lectured.,3143
Kako,This is a step up from before but you still messed up here. Are you doing this on purpose to get me angry?,3143
Kako,What am I writing? Your agenda of course. Without it you'd just slide right back to your old habits.,3144
Kako,I'll be here any time you have questions.,3144
Kako,Did you see that? This is the true power of our fleet!,3145
Kalk,You need to give me good equipments~ This way those mean aircrafts won’t hurt me anymore.,3145
Kalk,Hurry up and check your mail!,3146

Kalk,Let’s charge ahead against the roaring wind——,3148
Kalk,It doesn’t matter I am very lucky. We should should be able to survive!,3149
Kalk,"Try out my Valentine's chocolate~ Oh come on I promise there's no hot sauce in it! ""What about chili powder""? No not that either this time! You have to believe me!",3149
Kalk,Have some of Kalk's chocolate~ Is it good? Ehehe you're fine with chili sauce? I'm so glad!,3150
Kalk,I've successfully created a savory fusion of hot sauce and chocolate! It's hot yet sweet at the same time and I just know you'll love it. Give it a taste!,3150
Kalk,Hobby is so cute isn't she? I'd love to be as outgoing as her.,3151
Kalk,Want to come with me? Mhm let's head to school together then!,3151
Kalk,MVP? Hehe thanks for everyone’s support.,3152
Köln,Ah We went over budget again this month,3152
Köln,New missions have been posted. Shall I add them to today's schedule?,3153
Köln,Mission complete! Shall I take an inventory of the rewards?,3153
Köln,Your fleet has returned from their commission. Should I join you for the inspection?,3154
Köln,Enemy fleet spotted! Prepare torpedoes!,3154
Köln,Phew This performance should be acceptable?,3155
Köln,Ugh I failed again. P-please don't dismantle me,3155
Köln,Yes the time is now!,3156
Köln,Is there anything that I can help with? Please let me know.,3156
Köln,I'm so glad that you are an approachable superior. I can't really handle short-tempered people.,3157
Köln,To to prevent you from harassing my sisters I-I will (blushes),3157
Köln,I've discussed this with Amazon before since the two of us are usually busier on Valentine's Day. But the sense of accomplishment I get from watching the Iron Blood's children grow and get better each year is simply irreplaceable. Plus the smile on your face when you receive their chocolate is priceless too.,3158
Köln,In addition to my handmade chocolate I've also prepared you some healthy recipes if you end up eating too much. You may accept chocolate from everyone with peace of mind knowing I'll be watching your health over the coming weeks N-no I assure you that's not just an excuse to be around you all the time.,3158
Köln,Today's task list. I've taken the liberty of sorting them in order of priority. Please review them.,3159
Köln,Data aside if there's anything else you'd like to know please don't hesitate to ask.,3159
Köln,Such desk work demands a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. Well I suppose that means I should hope my sisters don't come barging in,3160
Köln,Don't you have more important things to be doing than staring at me or chatting with me?,3160
Kamikaze,Aha you've finally showed up~! Will we be doin' anything interesting today?,3161
Kamikaze,Hoho~ What about me's gotten you so interested?,3161
Kamikaze,Winners are those who hold out 'till the very end!,3162
Kamikaze,Hawksbill! That girl couldn't beat me but she put up a real good fight.,3162
Kamikaze,Those Fifth Carrier Division folks they're pretty nice,3163
Kamikaze,Oh? You need somethin'?,3163
Kamikaze,Well well looks like your naughty desires are starting to show themselves. How about an exorcism for ya?,3164
Kamikaze,Duties eh. How's about we go give it a look?,3164
Kamikaze,Hm? Payment for those duties? Right then take care bringing 'em here!,3165
Kamikaze,Mail eh It ain't an errand from the Union is it?,3165
Kamikaze,Look at you back safe and sound! Reward yourself with a sip of my nutritious drink! Hey now don't be shy~!,3166
Kamikaze,Guess the commission team's back again all in one piece. Hum hum splendid!,3166
Kamikaze,Yup I'm just oozing with energy~ Hoho~! Now I can go on another rampage~,3167
Kamikaze,Watch out for them submarines and torpedoes. Full speed ahead!,3167
Kamikaze,You see this? This is what years of experience looks like!,3168
Kamikaze,Ugh Should've known I can't keep up like this,3168
Kamikaze,Sorry ain't got time for one-on-ones.,3169
Kamikaze,My hobbies? 3 rounds of food and sleep and a bit of teasin' you. Hohoho~! That look there is what I wanted to see.,3169
Kamikaze,Ohohoho you must have a sharp eye if you've decided to retrofit me~ Now that I've been chosen I cannot afford to embarrass you. Now take a good and thorough look at this veteran's aspirations~,3170
Kamikaze,I went for a romp with some of those Mutsuki-class children but they proved no more than a bothersome bunch of pipsqueaks.,3170
Kamikaze,My wind chime? It quite strikes my fancy though it is a bit too large. Watch yourself so you don't get whacked by it!,3171
Kamikaze,Ah Haguro Ashigara and Myoukou How I miss the days of watching over those younglings~,3171
Kamikaze,Being in the first Destroyer Division and being the first of my class it's only natural I also get first place!,3172
Königsberg,Now then let us begin today’s training.,3172
Königsberg,Remember it’s unwise to place too much faith into the numbers.,3173
Königsberg,Making an expression like that are you after some of big sister’s rough affection?,3173
Königsberg,Whipping doesn’t actually hurt that much once you’re used to it. Want to give it a go?,3174
Königsberg,Oh? You seem fairly energetic today. Let's do some more training.,3174
Königsberg,Oh my? That’s not how you do it. Should I teach you the proper way to touch a girl?,3175
Königsberg,Let's see what mission is up next.,3175
Königsberg,Remember to read new mail as soon as possible. It’s rude to make people wait.,3176
Königsberg,The girls have returned from commissions. Please welcome them back in a timely manner.,3176
Königsberg,It's time to see what we learned from our training and make our enemies tremble before us!,3177
Königsberg,Hmph so that’s all they amounted to.,3177
Königsberg,Tsk Do we still not have enough anti-air?,3178
Königsberg,Hmm do you want some lessons from me too?,3178
Königsberg,Alright time for me to punish you.,3179
Königsberg,Hey! What were you trying to do? Don't be shy just tell me.,3179
Königsberg,Hmm? I do you like you very much in many different ways I'm going to teach you all kinds of things from now on Hehe,3180
Königsberg,Did you want me to feed you chocolate? I'd make a point about avoiding prying eyes but since you made this request in the middle of your office during broad daylight I assume you're fine with whatever comes of it. Or perhaps is this some kind of kink? Since it is Valentine's Day I don't mind entertaining your request but I hope you didn't expect me to do anything absurd like feeding you mouth-to-mouth?,3180
Königsberg,You know I thought I had disciplined you plenty but it seems I cannot cure your passion for Valentine's Day. Although it's more fun this way. Heehee Seeing as you're so keen I'll let you choose how I'll feed you – by hand mouth-to-mouth or any other way you like.,3181
Karlsruhe,Ehehe I have a feeling something good will happen today!,3181
Karlsruhe,La~ la~ la~ When is the next battle?,3182
Karlsruhe,Is.. is there a storm coming?,3182
Karlsruhe,Boring~ boring! How do you expect me to stay quiet?,3183
Karlsruhe,Nyahaha! That tickles!,3183
Karlsruhe,Nya? Why do I feel so hot where you touched me?,3184
Karlsruhe,Mission~ Mission~ It's time to make some money~!,3184

Karlsruhe,I've found the strength to continue exploring afar.,3186
Karlsruhe,Let me show you my true power Here I come!,3187
Karlsruhe,Eh? I won?,3187
Karlsruhe,Uu I let my guard down,3188
Karlsruhe,I have a feeling this one's gonna hit!,3188
Karlsruhe,I don't want to play with you anymore,3189
Karlsruhe,I don't like being cooped up in the house nor do I like that pesky Truant! When I look at it that way isn't this my destiny?,3189
Karlsruhe,"I asked my sister about it and she said that this feeling is called ""love."" It feels a bit painful but it also makes me very happy.",3190
Karlsruhe,I feel happy whenever I think about you but I miss you whenever I can't see you. Overall I'm still glad that I fell in love with you!,3190
Karlsruhe,Do you know the kinds of storms I had to brave to secure the ingredients for this chocolate? The old me would have been sent home with my equipment in tatters let alone be ready to make any chocolate. But I'm fine now! Here hurry up and try it!,3191
Karlsruhe,So this year I made chocolate using only ingredients imported straight from Iron Blood! This could be the new standard for your chocolate moving forward so I wanna get you used to it. What do you think? Is it good?,3191
Karlsruhe,Königsberg-class light cruiser – Karlsruhe.,3192
Karlsruhe,I'll give any storm a good thrashing! Hyaah!,3192
Karlsruhe,Did you call? If you want to play I'm down any time!,3193
Kashino,My weapon? Hyah! Eh? I look really cool? D-don't say that I barely know how to use it,3193
Kashino,Am I carrying main guns again? Ah sorry I spaced out a bit,3194
Kashino,Oh! S-sorry did I hit you with my tail?,3194
Kashino,Do you still have missions to complete? Please be mindful of the deadlines.,3195
Kashino,Mission complete~ That's one fewer thing to worry about.,3195
Kashino,The commission team has returned safely. Let's go greet them. Having that said I'm used to being in their position though not the other way around~,3196
Kashino,Hmm Was I supposed to feel different?,3196
Kashino,Anti-air combat commencing!,3197
Kashino,This sense of elation is rather mysterious Mm,3197
Kashino,Ugh It's hard for me to keep up with the actual warships,3198
Kashino,I've brought the supplies!,3198
Kashino,It's just a scratch Don't worry I can keep going!,3199
Kashino,I can bring you all the supplies in the world but you don't seem to be capable of using them well,3199
Kashino,My rigging is a bit different from that of the other girls. Want to learn more? Mm why don't you come take a seat on my deck then?,3200
Kashino,I often play with the little destroyers. Like this I put one on each shoulder and pretend like I'm some giant monster or robot Yes it's quite fun~,3200
Kashino,As a munition ship I may not be very useful in combat. However as long as you believe in me and cherish me I'll try to be as useful as I can in other ways! Mhm!,3201
Kashino,"Hnnnngh! S-sorry. I was on my way to deliver chocolate but I tripped and then it was gone You say it's stuck ""between them""? Have you found it?! Thank goodness Go ahead and eat it as-is if it's still good!",3201
Kashino,You want to take me to the hot springs on our next day off? Really?! I'm so happy to hear that!,3202
Kashino,Milky Manjuu? Are you talking about that drink that used to be popular? I can make it if you'd like.,3202
Kashino,Mm Nnh S-sorry this sometimes happen when I listen to the windchimes Zzz,3203
Kashino,The munitions I brought paid off~,3203
Kashino,If there's anything lacking about these hot springs it's the fact that this place is too small If you're not careful it's easy to slip or to bump into various things,3204
Kashino,A nice bottle of milk after a refreshing soak really hits the spot~ Let's get another bottle later~ Um I knocked the first one over when I slipped earlier,3204
Kashino,Shall I wash your back for you?,3205
Kashino,Th-they're pretty heavy right?,3205
Kashino,I've kept the fresh milk in the fridge back there. After you've finished bathing please feel free to help yourself~,3206
Kashino,Oww My luck isn't so good today,3206
Kashino,Being a maid is a lot harder than I thought I can do physical labor and simple chores just fine but deep cleaning never goes well.,3207
Kashino,How did this happen you say? Well um I'm not too sure myself. You say this doesn't normally happen? Ooh,3207
Kashino,The ingredients are on the shelves and the snacks are in the fridge. There's cold milk in there too so feel free to help yourself.,3208
Kashino,Honestly it's really hard to maintain this posture. Umm b-because they're really heavy *blush*,3208
Kashino,Oh I c-can't get out this way either,3209
Kashino,Hnnngh Mail's here! I had to struggle to pick that one up!,3209
Kashino,Nnngh! Haah haah I just can't get out. They said this store was built well but this isn't especially reassuring is it?,3210
Kashino,The commission team is back! Uh umm I can't exactly greet them like this can I?,3210
Kashino,Want to see how a maid fights? Get ready!,3211
Kashino,Phew I'm glad I took extra-special care to avoid messing anything up.,3211
Kashino,Honestly this outfit is more suited to service than combat,3212
Kasumi,Kasumi can see lots of things that others can't like Foo here for example. Kasumi saw that Foo was all alone so we became friends.,3212
Kasumi,Foo is my good friend. We're always together.,3213
Kasumi,It'd be nice if Foo could get the mail,3213
Kasumi,Foo is Kasumi any different?,3214
Kasumi,Foo let's do our best?,3214
Kasumi,Foo we did it.,3215
Kasumi,Foo make sure to protect the others.,3215
Kasumi,Let's do our best everyone.,3216
Kasumi,Kasumi is very strong when she gets serious!,3216
Kasumi,Foo can't handle being around lots of people so Kasumi also dislikes crowded places,3217
Kasumi,Foo told me I have to make chocolate for Valentine's Day So I made this Foo-shaped one. It looks sticky? No it looks like Foo.,3217
Kasumi,Kasumi thinks that her outfit has gotten a bit breezier. Foo said the same thing.,3218
Kasumi,Hello. Foo and Kasumi have been waiting for you.,3218
Kasumi,Kasumi is here so Foo is never lonely. And Kasumi has lots of friends so everything is good.,3219
Kasumi,Kasumi wants to help people. Foo does too. We're gonna try to be as helpful as we can.,3219
Kasumi,Kasumi has more energy than before. If you feel tired just sit next to Kasumi and rest.,3220
Kasumi,Shiranui became a friend so Foo isn't scared of her anymore.,3220
Kasumi,Warm and comforting clothes Warm and comforting red bean soup Ahh I love New Year's.,3221
Kasumi,The mochi inside red bean soup is delicious and fun to play with. Seconds please~,3221
Kasumi,Miss Ghost would you like to be friends with Foo? Huh? You aren't really a ghost?,3222
Kasumi,Foo you want to eat some mochi too? I'm not sure that's possible sorry.,3222
Kasumi,My bag is unzipped? Must be one of Foo's pranks. It's definitely not because Kasumi left in a hurry.,3223
Kasumi,Foo follows Kasumi everywhere to and from school and even in class.,3223
Kasumi,There are will-o'-the-wisps around port Maybe Foo can befriend them.,3224
Kasumi,I wish Foo could help me with my homework.,3224
Kasumi,You're giving a speech at the opening ceremony? I wonder what you'll talk about,3225
Katsuragi,If you want to keep me company so badly Well I just happened to not have anyone to talk to so you'll have to make do! In any case let me start by telling you about my favorite kind of azalea––,3225
Katsuragi,Skip bombing? I must admit it was quite an imaginative tactic. The Eagle Union was even able to give one as cute and strong as me a headache! Ahahaha!,3226
Katsuragi,If you're tired just let me handle the paperwork. Nobody would notice the difference if I forged your signature Ah uh that was obviously just a joke!,3226
Katsuragi,I left half a cake for you on your desk. Why only half you ask? Well that's because I already ate the other half! Ahahaha!,3227
Katsuragi,What's the matter? Oh you need me for something? Well seeing how earnestly you're beseeching my aid I have no choice but to at least consider it~,3227
Katsuragi,You think you can mess with my heart just by patting my head? How naive! If you remember to keep it up 365 days of the year maybe you'll have a shot.,3228
Katsuragi,Hrrrrmm Don't tell me you still have unfinished missions lying around?,3228
Katsuragi,Quite satisfactory! With such abundant rewards you'll be able to further expand your scope of work and have even more missions assigned to you! But Hehe are you able to shoulder that immense workload?,3229
Katsuragi,New mail has arrived! Now then is it something important? Perhaps a mission notice? Or maybe? Darn it hurry up and open it up already~,3229
Katsuragi,Ohh you're back! So like something totally weird happened while you were gone. A little bird got lost inside the office and it was really hard for us to guide it back out~ Your place seems to be really popular with the birdies–– Hey are you listening?,3230
Katsuragi,The commission rewards are in~ I'm only responsible for informing you though you'll have to carry the goods yourself~,3230
Katsuragi,Mhm that's more like it! I'll offer you some words of praise for recognizing my worth!,3231
Katsuragi,Harrumph! With me at helm victory is already assured!,3231
Katsuragi,Oh~hohoho~ How could you absolute nobodies hope to win against the might of a true aircraft carrier such as myself~,3232
Katsuragi,We lost?! Even though I did everything I could?! Ugh How could things have gone so wrong??,3232
Katsuragi,Pay close attention to this!,3233
Katsuragi,Are you really going to let your all-important aircraft carrier get hit like this?!,3233
Katsuragi,How many times have I had to explain this to you before? I can do everything that an aircraft carrier is supposed to do but I can't do anything outside of that because that's just what I used to be!,3234
Katsuragi,"You know how in those books if there's someone on your mind it normally goes something like ""your face gets all red and you can't find the words to say?"" But like in my case I just can't stop talking at all Ah! I get it now! I'm not the one who's nervous you are! Hey are you listening to me?",3234
Katsuragi,You keep squirming away from me but today I'll make sure you absolutely listen to every single word. Got it? Good! Ahem! I Katsuragi am bound by oath to you and swear to always be at your side through joy or hardship! Mm excellent. Now it's your turn to repeat that back to me!,3235
Katsuragi,One document two documents three documents What am I doing? Seeing how there's nothing for me to do at the moment I thought I'd count your files to pass the time!,3235
Katsuragi,So tell me what is this super important ultra difficult mission that you cannot entrust to anyone but Katsuragi?,3236
Katsuragi,Hwaah?! D-don't you know that you need to give me time to prepare myself before doing stuff like that? *blush*,3236
Katsuragi,Uhhh So how far are we into those 365 days? Well seeing how I can't remember let's start over from day one.,3237
Katsuragi,Oh~ho~ho! With you commanding from the rear victory was all but assured!,3237
Katsuragi,You came here looking for someone to talk to right? I suppose I can keep you company then but you should make sure you go around and deepen your bonds with everyone else too! Except Junyou watch out for that one!,3238
Katsuragi,"When the fireworks climb high into the sky and go ""kaboom"" I can feel my excitement doing the very same thing! Ahahaha!",3238
Katsuragi,Missions? Can't you let it rest for a day and just enjoy the day off??,3239
Katsuragi,Excellent! With these earnings we'll be able to eat as much as we want Well yeah I know that! We need to share with everyone else too! B-but I'd be really happy if you treated me to a little something Please?,3239
Katsuragi,Victory is mine! That's how a real carrier does things duh!,3240
Kawakaze,Just another uneventful day.,3240
Kawakaze,I like fishing. When fishing you can just clear your mind and not think about anything.,3241
Kawakaze,Shells are weapons to silence one's enemies with. That's all they are no matter how you sugarcoat it.,3241
Kawakaze,If there's something you're wondering ask Jintsuu. I'm if I must say I'd say I'm more like Sendai.,3242
Kawakaze,Pretty cheerful gang you've got going with this fleet,3242
Kawakaze,How I feel about secretary work? Work is work I don't have any preferences. Secretary or not I don't care.,3243
Kawakaze, Now you've really done it,3243
Kawakaze,New mission's appeared.  What? Do I have to make small talk with you?,3244
Kawakaze,Mission rewards are here. Let's see if they were worth the time. But first accept them.,3244
Kawakaze,Mail for you. Me? Not a fan of the stuff,3245
Kawakaze,What happens when the battle ends? The next one begins that's all.,3245
Kawakaze,A commission's done. Don't forget to read the report.,3246
Kawakaze,Getting stronger feels okay.,3246
Kawakaze,War war never changes.,3247
Kawakaze,The Solomon Islands they call for me,3247
Kawakaze,I'm still afloat. If that's good or bad who can say,3248
Kawakaze,Relax. I will end this in an instant.,3248
Kawakaze,This pain isn't enough to distract me!,3249
Kawakaze,In war there is no right or wrong no beauty or ugliness. This is true for both ally and enemy.,3249
Kawakaze,Have you not experienced war too? Then why do you still believe in fairy tales like justice love or harmony?,3250
Kawakaze,I abhor the stupidity and naïveté of those who refuse to face reality and continue shouting about their hopes and dreams. But you're not like that are you?,3250
Kawakaze,"Your dreams will come true if you don't give up on them"" Hmph what a trite answer. But if that's what you say",3251
Kawakaze,I'm astonished that I'm doing this with you We've been together so long that your wishful thinking has rubbed off on me And for doing so you'll take responsibility won't you?,3251
Kawakaze,"I've finished my preparations. Though I am still a bit worried I've left the guardianship of the Great Fox to my Yamakaze and Umikaze just as I promised to you. If only I could share the same desire for this ""Valentine's date"" that you speak of I mean um I was really looking forward to it but um",3252
Kawakaze,Shall we go on another Valentine's date this year? I'm amazed that days like today have become so commonplace to me. It's not bad but it feels weird to think about Well I'm sure that accepting these emotions is part of enjoying Valentine's.,3252
Kawakaze,This must be the dream you've awaited so eagerly Of course I vowed to be with you to the end of our days. I shall take my rightful place beside you and your wishful thinking. We are together.,3253
Kawakaze,This must be the dream you've awaited so eagerly Of course I vowed to be with you until the end of our days. I shall take my rightful place beside you and your ideals. We are together.,3253
Kawakaze,Today is another day devoid of change. But nothing needs to change if I can happily remain by your side.,3254
Kawakaze,I want you to pay Lady Nagato a visit from time to time. There's little I can do to ease her loneliness but I believe that you can. Don't you worry I know you'll still come to see me as well.,3254
Kawakaze,The same sword that takes lives can also save them. It is my goal to become that: a sword that protects.,3255
Kawakaze,You must not fixate on only either brains or brawn. The ideal leader is both wise and strong. Ahahah here I am paraphrasing Naka.,3255
Kawakaze,How I feel about secretary work? Work is work that is all. I will gladly do anything for you.,3256
Kawakaze,It's humiliating to watch the other girls get ahead of me,3256
Kawakaze,What is it?,3257
Kawakaze,You have new missions. Shall we have a casual discourse while you review them?,3257
Kawakaze,Mission rewards are here. Hopefully they'll have been worth our efforts.,3258
Kawakaze,When the fighting ends I will always be here waiting for you. Put your mind at rest.,3258
Kawakaze,I fight for the one I love!,3259
Kawakaze,"Your dreams will come true if you don't give up on them."" They will so let us make them real. I swear it to you upon all my being.",3259
Kawakaze,Today might actually be an eventful day.,3260
Kawakaze,On the battlefield you swing your weapon and defeat the enemy no more. Thinking about other things comes after the battle.,3260
Kawakaze,Seems having some cheerful people by your side might not be so bad.,3261
Kawakaze,Do you like kendo too? I'll work you to the bone to make you good at it.  Huh? You don't wanna do it?,3261
Kawakaze,Phew I was considering chopping off your hand had you gone any further.,3262
Kazagumo,I like being alone in my own room. What exactly do I do in my free time? I'm not telling you.,3262
Kazagumo,You're on duty so no chit-chatting with me allowed okay? I mean if you feel really lonely then maybe,3263
Kazagumo,I like the satisfying toot-toot noise that recorders make Do you wanna hear it? It'll have to be later not now,3263
Kazagumo,You'll be cursed for this,3264
Kazagumo,I'm not a pet so don't treat me like one,3264
Kazagumo,Look at all these unfinished missions You should really do something about them.,3265
Kazagumo,Mission complete. Wonder if I'll get a reward for my efforts,3265
Kazagumo,The commission team's back. Don't forget to say hi to them Me? Uhh I think I'll stay right here.,3266
Kazagumo,We can win this Right?,3266
Kazagumo,It'd be great if we could keep winning,3267
Kazagumo,Ugh. I'm really out of it today,3267
Kazagumo,I wanna get this over with,3268
Kazagumo,Watch beneath the waves,3268
Kazagumo,I guess we're all fated to be alone. You me and everyone else,3269
Kazagumo,You want to be friends with me? Okay but if I find out you're planning something bad then I'll never talk to you again.,3269
Kazagumo,You're not a bad person so we can be friends Do I wish I had more friends? I'm not gonna tell you.,3270
Kazagumo,I think this is when you promise to never leave me. First you say it then it's my turn Hehehe~ Thank you. I love you.,3270
Kazagumo,This is the day when you eat sweets right? Then here you go. What's in the box? I'm not telling. If I did you'd say something weird and I'd probably run away out of embarrassment.,3271
Kazagumo,I've got you some chocolate just because I felt like it That's all you need to know. What kind of chocolate? Valen– Err No I'm not telling you!,3271
Kazagumo,Try to focus on your work. Unlike me you can concentrate even when someone's staring at you right? Hehehe~,3272
Kazagumo,Are you feeling a little lonely? Hehehe~,3272
Kazagumo,You still wanna hear me play even if I'm not good at it? But I'd rather not. Not when others are around,3273
Kazagumo,I've practiced some more. I'll play you a song if you'll listen On second thought maybe I won't.,3273
Kazagumo,Weird I played pretty well just a moment ago but now I can't do it,3274
Kazagumo,The name of the song I just played? I'm not gonna tell you right now. After I've mastered it all right?,3274
Kazagumo,You're so nice hanging out with me even after school I'm not taking up your time am I?,3275
Kazagumo,Ugh I lost track of the tempo because of that Thanks meanie.,3275
Kazagumo,I'm glad we won. Hehehe.,3276
Kazagumo,Who is that launching fireworks over there I wonder? Watching from directly below seems dangerous but I bet they look prettiest from there,3276
Kazagumo,Why am I out here all by myself? Because I get to be alone with Oops ignore that. I can't tell you,3277
Kazagumo,You're tired from swimming? Take a break here with me. I'll watch over you so you can even take a nap if you want.,3277
Kazagumo,Umm actually I've been practicing a new song. Want me to play—Ack the fireworks! Maybe another time!,3278
Kazagumo,I wonder where Shimakaze went How can she not be tired after playing on the beach all day?,3278

Kazagumo,Huh? Oh *blushes*,3279
Kazagumo,You finished a mission. Is there a reward for me too?,3280
Kazagumo,If you really want some ice cream Wait you had it delivered with the mail? A-aww,3280
Kazagumo,*blows* I'd better eat this ice cream before it melts Would I get brain freeze if I just bit into it?,3281
Kent,Errr Graciously overlook my poor armour and firepower please!,3281
Kent,I forgot that Tigre isn't around,3282
Kent,I think I've seen ships from the Far East before They look really strong!,3282
Kent,Hmmm a new mission want to take a stab at it?,3283
Kent,Mission rewards! Let's take a look!,3283

Kent,I'm disappointed We don't make a good team at all.,3288
Kent,Greetings! Contestant Kent is here to hand you her handmade chocolate! I may not look the part but I'm still a small player in the Maid fleet so of course I'm great at making sweets!,3288
Kent,Hello! Contestant Kent is here to wish you a happy Valentine's Day! I also have this wonderful treat which I worked hard on! Now as is tradition Ahem! Master what would you like for dessert? Chocolate chocolate or perhaps chocolate?,3289
Kiev,Huff puff There Ah I just thought I'd write something on the window.,3289
Kiev,I'll show no mercy to anyone that tries to harm you. Assisting you and protecting you are one and the same to me.,3290
Kiev,Growing flowers are way beyond me. The only plants I can be trusted with are cacti They can survive even if you neglect them.,3290
Kiev,I wanna come closer Is that fine?,3291
Kiev,I love it when you pet me. I need more Please?,3291
Kiev,Someone should claim these mission rewards Is it fine if I do it?,3292
Kiev,There's mail for you. I think it's important. Are you fine with me fetching it?,3292
Kiev,Our commission comrades are back. Seeing all their smiling faces makes me envious,3293
Kiev,We can't forego routine maintenance and upgrades. Right?,3293
Kiev,There's no ice I cannot break through!,3294
Kiev,Abandoning my comrades to save myself I refuse to do that!,3294
Kiev,We're fighting on MY terms now!,3295
Kiev,Am I the cause of your sadness? Would you cheer up if I simply disappeared?,3295
Kiev,Do you think I'm cold? Or unapproachable? That's something I want to change about myself but I don't know how,3296
Kiev,I've made many new friends with your help But you're my first and still closest friend. I want to get even closer to you. Are you fine with that?,3296
Kiev,Whenever we're apart or whenever you're about to leave my heart aches like it's being torn in two I want to always always be with you. Will you stay with me?,3297
Kiev,Huff puff There I wrote your name and mine in the fog on the window. This looks fine right?,3297
Kiev,I never wanna become a cactus. If I could grow in spite of neglect then I worry people would actually abandon me,3298
Kiev,New missions They're not so tough when I have you.,3298
Kiev,Are you gonna go claim the mission rewards? Would it be fine if I went with you?,3299
Kiev,You're back by my side again Phew. Now I feel fine.,3299
Kiev,Just have to fight Everything will go fine!,3300
Kiev,Please never leave me behind. I promise I will keep you safe.,3300
Kiev,I want to be the only one for you. Of all the girls close to you I want to be your most faithful one. When you look at all of us I want to be the only one you really see That's fine right?,3301
Kiev,Seeing you here puts me at ease. I know this stakeout will go smoothly as long as you're here. Mhm all is fine.,3301
Kiev,My black clothes let me blend in but my silver hair does the opposite The net result is that I stand out.,3302
Kiev,There's no one suspicious in sight But we must keep our eyes peeled.,3302
Kiev,I feel safe when I'm with you and I don't wanna leave your side It's fine if we stick together right?,3303
Kiev,Wonder how it's going for the others. Kronshtadt said to maintain radio silence which I'm fine with since you're here.,3303
Kiev,Hold hands? Okay. Is this fine?,3304
Kiev,They've caught on to us? Then I'll fight head-on!,3304
Kiev,All foes are down. Nobody spotted me. Job well done right?,3305
Kii,Look who's finally clocked in hahahah! My trigger finger's gotten itchy so let's get on with a sortie already!,3305
Kii,Tell me if anyone starts picking on you. I'll put them in their place! And I mean it for the most part you hear?,3306
Kii,Hey Suruga! What do you say to going drinking with me and the gang once work is done? Figures always so antisocial When people invite you you should go with it!,3306
Kii,Something on your mind? I might be able to help you with it.,3307
Kii,"Friendly friskiness"" is it? Hmm Sure I guess?",3307
Kii,A new mission? If it's about turning hostiles to scrap I'll get it done!,3308
Kii,We're wrapping up these missions nicely! Great!,3308
Kii,A letter eh? If it's an open duel then I accept their challenge! Oh no duel huh,3309
Kii,I reckon we'll garner more fame by winning battles than by wasting time in port don't you agree?,3309
Kii,That last commission was kinda mediocre Still they deserve a congratulatory moment. Want to come with me?,3310
Kii,Let's see how strong I've really gotten. Send me into battle!,3310
Kii,Let's duke it out fair and square!,3311
Kii,Victory's ours. Heheh now that was refreshing all right.,3311
Kii,Dammit Not enough firepower for the job huh?,3312
Kii,Let's give 'em a dazzling show!,3312
Kii,These guys are tougher than I expected!,3313
Kii,I'm so tired of bosses that can't handle their subordinates like you.,3313
Kii,Thought as much. I'll help you with your training then! Come on out of your room and into the fresh outdoors for some jogging! And later we'll do some sparring!,3314
Kii,There's no fun in knocking a battle out of the park if nobody's there to witness it. Anyway once this work is done I'll go train with Hyuuga. After that you I and Suruga will go for a drink with Ise! Sound good to you?,3314
Kii,People say you can push yourself harder if it's to protect someone. Then for everyone's sake I Kii shall become the strongest battleship Pfft yeah right! Hahahahah!,3315
Kii,I mean we don't need to go that far. We're already dearly important to one another aren't we? Don't worry I'll still accept it! And of course I'll keep on keeping you safe just like I always have!,3315
Kii,Happy Valentine's! I wasn't sure whether to get you chocolate or spirits so I went and got you chocolates filled with liqueur! That's twice the fun I'd say. By the way I heard Suruga worked her ass off in the kitchen. Don't forget to tell her thanks later!,3316
Kii,Look who's arrived early. Now then where are we going on a sortie today?,3316
Kii,Say how about a little drink after the working day is done? Although since my drinking pals are coming along I guess we'll have more than just a little! Hahahahah!,3317
Kii,Physical contact doesn't normally bother me but you clearly did that on purpose!,3317
Kii,Come here! Let's fight to the last ship sailing!,3318
Kii,Now this is a victory I want the whole world to see! Hahahahah!,3318
Kii,Refreshing drinks delicious food warm sunshine and a pool to beat the heat? Heh isn't this the essence of summer?,3319
Kii,There you are at last. Want to get something to eat if you're hungry? Like dumplings or a rice ball or something.,3319
Kii,"Hey Suruga let's go somewhere– Come on don't be all ""I like it indoors"" and ""I'd rather not draw attention"" just come out and enjoy the summer with us!",3320
Kii,Akashi sure got that vending machine and stall set up quick She's ingenious but only when there's money to be made,3320
Kii,Why the hesitation? It's just a pool. Nothing wrong with just swimming together with me is there?,3321
Kii,Want to head to that other area? I'll come with you.,3321
Kimberly,Being punctual is a good habit to have so please keep it up.,3322
Kimberly,Just what are you looking at? You ought to hurry up and return to your post.,3322
Kimberly,If you are tired please take a break. If you were to collapse the command chain would follow suit.,3323
Kimberly,For me no matter where I am or what I am called I will continue to fight on as long as I live.,3323
Kimberly,I was born for battle and died for peace. Other than this fact I won't dwell on anything else.,3324
Kimberly,What tasks are there?,3324
Kimberly,Do you want to pay a visit to the court martial?,3325
Kimberly,What is the meaning of this?,3325
Kimberly,Mission complete. However your work doesn't end there.,3326
Kimberly,Strengthening combat effectiveness is also an important link when it comes to battle.,3326
Kimberly,Prepare to meet the enemies.,3327
Kimberly,This is a fine example of tactical synergy. Let's keep it up.,3327
Kimberly,Strategic retreat,3328
Kimberly,Let's put this needless battle to an end!,3328
Kimberly,Damage confirmed continuing combat.,3329
Kimberly,The incompetent will be weeded out by time. You are no exception.,3329
Kimberly,As long as we keep on winning will we be able to bring an end to the war? Rather than searching for the answer to that question it would be more practical to focus on winning the battles ahead of us.,3330
Kimberly,"What do I plan to do after the war is over?"" Hmm I've never given this much thought nor have I wanted to. However why did you bring it up all of a sudden?",3330
Kimberly,Recently I had a strange dream. I dreamt that I wasn't on the battlefield but instead taking a walk along the port hand-in-hand with someone close to me Wh-what's so funny?,3331
Kimberly,After discussing things with my sisters a bit I realized that if the war actually ended I wouldn't know how to do anything else Eh you'd stay with me and teach me yourself so there would be no problem? E-ehhh?,3331
Kimberly,"S-so this is a promise ring Really I never could have imagined that this would happen to me However I'm truly truly happy from the bottom of my heart. Is this the ""love"" that my sisters were talking about? Hey don't laugh!",3332
Kimberly,I did the best I could but I guess I still don't know the trick to making chocolate. I'm sorry for how shabby it is But next time I'll make some proper chocolate I promise you!,3332
Kimberly,I made you some Dragon Empery-style chocolate. They used to call it something different but I wonder if they still use that name I should've looked into it but I didn't have enough time this year!,3333
Kimberly,Mullany the secret ingredient known as love isn't a tangible thing but rather the feelings you pour into your chocolate Ugh forget I said that! Just try it out!,3333
Kimberly,There are many differences between the Eagle Union and the Dragon Empery but the one thing that doesn't change no matter where you are is everyone's desire for a better future.,3334
Kimberly,Ugh calligraphy is really difficult,3334
Kimberly,If you put things off for tomorrow you'll find that there's always another tomorrow. That's why you shouldn't put off today's missions for tomorrow.,3335
Kimberly,"Every time I return to port I feel a wave of relief wash over me. Is this what ""home"" is?",3335
Kimberly,When I'm with you I feel energized and my productivity goes through the roof. Perhaps this is your magic spell? Hehe~,3336
King_George_V,Wales and Yorkie? It's a bit of a shame that they don't act more like cute little sisters but I am glad that they have strong personalities.,3336
King_George_V,The Royals' cuisine is all bland? Hogwash. That's just an unfortunate stereotype.,3337
King_George_V,Why do I have a mountain of snacks before me? Isn't it obvious? One cannot move on an empty stomach.,3337
King_George_V,New missions eh? It would be ideal if we got something a bit more challenging.,3338
King_George_V,A letter huh? Now then is this a challenge or a love letter?,3338
King_George_V,There's some commotion by the port? Oh it seems to just be the commission team returning.,3339
King_George_V,Hmm I suddenly feel like having a lavish feast.,3339
King_George_V,Let us go forth and plant our banners!,3340
King_George_V,Make no mistakes. I shall ensure both victory and the safety of all my comrades.,3340
King_George_V,Do not be demoralized. Neither victory nor defeat are decided by a single battle.,3341
King_George_V,The glory of the sun that never sets shall not fade!,3341
King_George_V,Hmph how interesting!,3342
King_George_V,My greatest hobbies in life are food and fighting. While I am more than capable of fighting alone dining by myself is quite difficult and lonesome. To be able to find someone who can share both of these things with me is truly a joyous thing.,3342
King_George_V,Almost all of these dishes were prepared by none other than myself - and the chocolates are no exception. After all I wish to provide you with nothing less than a full Royal reception. What sort of host would I be without keeping my personally-invited guest entertained?,3343
King_George_V,Valentine's Day is ultimately no more than an excuse to throw a dinner party. Having said that I have been looking forward to sharing a feast with you. In fact I've been looking forward to it for a long time. You'll get your chocolate later – for now let us have a toast to how far we've come on our journey!,3343
King_George_V,Ugh I'm expected to act more proper when I'm wearing formal attire. Can't even go around trying all the different delicacies what a drag,3344
King_George_V,Issuing tasks during our banquet? Those folks sure know how to ruin the mood.,3344
King_George_V,Let's use these rewards to decorate the venue.,3345
King_George_V,Bad luck friends. You chose the wrong day to get in my way.,3345
Kinu,Hurry up and make today's plans.,3346
Kinu,You're welcome to inspect the other stuff but you'd be best off not casually touching my demonic raiments.,3346
Kinu,Somebody I can't stand? I guess that'd be Nagara. She's the– Whuah Nagara?! W-Wait don't get any closer! MMPH URMMMPHHH!,3347
Kinu,A new model of oxygen torpedo? I say do get me one of those. I promise I'll draw out every bit of its power.,3347
Kinu,My cloak's pretty cool? Heh~ you think so too huh? Hey stop trying to slack off!,3348
Kinu,You want to duel me? Don't worry I'll give you a handicap.,3348
Kinu,Really? Are you trying to get me mad?,3349
Kinu,Don't go around touching my head.,3349
Kinu,Don't forget about your missions. A soldier must fulfill the orders of their superiors.,3350
Kinu,Accept these rewards. You've earned this privilege.,3350
Kinu,You look like you're in a good mood. Are you the type that gets motivated the more you work?,3351
Kinu,The commission team must be getting impatient from waiting.,3351
Kinu,I won't be able to test whether or not this strengthening worked outside of live combat.,3352
Kinu,Just bring it on already!,3352
Kinu,Make an enemy of me and your defeat is already ensured.,3353
Kinu,Even I have become obsolete?,3353
Kinu,Don't even think about running!,3354
Kinu,Ahaha! Now you shall witness the form of a true demon!,3354
Kinu,Cowards shall never control a demon.,3355
Kinu,You may look like someone who is too gentle to hurt a fly yet you have control over this entire port. I'm a little interested in you.,3355
Kinu,I've heard that Yuubari is responsible for developing new equipment. If possible could you ask her to upgrade my equipment? For example starting with my torpedoes,3356
Kinu,How about letting me treat you to a couple cups of sake tonight? Hah don't worry I just want to have a normal chat. Having a heart-to-heart over some fine spirits what greater comfort in life is there?,3356
Kinu,Right then Valentine's chocolate. I am a girl you know. There's nothing weird about me giving you chocolate. You know?!,3357
Kinu,Here your Valentine's chocolate. You STILL want to try my handmade chocolate?! I I'm not gonna do that No it's not like I don't know how I just said Fine you know what? Next year I'll make you regret teasing me!,3357
Kinu,Why the nervous look? I said I'd make you chocolate and I'm true to my word. Nothing you say will stop me! Yes I nearly cut my hand a moment ago but that gives you no right to try to stop me! Understood?! Good. Do not underestimate this demon!,3358
Kinu,Behold my handmade chocolate! Worry not; my hands are unscathed! Hah! Who says you need a blade to cut chocolate? I realized that it was all too simple. This marks a great victory for ingenuity and grip strength!,3358
Kinu,Retrofit complete Look forward to commanding the might of the demon ascended. I shall not disappoint you!,3359
Kinu,My oni mask? Ah it's on the other side now. With my self-evident power there is no need to flaunt such things.,3359
Kinu,This time I won't resign myself to obsolescence!,3360
Kinu,Darn that Aoba With how she's always absent-mindedly flitting about what is she going to do when she ends up in actual danger?,3360
Kinu,This mantle was specifically made for me. See look here and here as well Gah! Ahem! Sorry I got carried away. I just wanted to make sure you knew.,3361
Kinu,If you want to spar with me you'd better think thrice. One slip of the hand and it won't be just a flesh wound that we're dealing with.,3361
Kinu,Ugh I'm still a woman you know! Have you no sense of decency?!,3362
Kinu,This is a true oni's wrath!,3362
Kinu,Grr! What are you here for? Speak up. Oh you just wanted to take a tour of the club activities? Sorry 'bout that I don't like getting disturbed in the middle of this kind of training.,3363
Kinu,Just finished my daily practice swings. Time to get back to work.,3363
Kinu,What Takao is doing can't be considered a club activity No I didn't mean anything by it. I just do what I like.,3364
Kinu,Unless you are a genius you can never depart from the fundamentals. Even if you are a genius you cannot afford to neglect the fundamentals either. That is the nature of swordsmanship.,3364
Kinu,Prince of Wales and Repulse huh? Hmph. I'd never call them cowards.,3365
Kinu,Isuzu clearly is also an oni but she's somehow afraid of ghosts. Me? Guh I suppose I can't deny that!,3365
Kinu,These little manjuu hardly make for good sparring partners. How about taking their place?,3366
Kinu,Sorry but these riggings are the real deal.,3366
Kinu,Well? I've still got one card in my hand. If you want to win then show me everything you've got! I will not have you disrespect me just for wearing a silly costume!,3367
Kinu,Eyes on your cards idiot. This is not a staring competition Wh-what? Are you hoping to unnerve me or something?,3367
Kinu,"What? No I'm not ""cute!"" I don't consider that a compliment!",3368
Kinu,You'd be an idiot to underestimate the demon.,3368
Kinu,S-so my costume is just that seductive huh?,3369
Kinu,Give me a minute I need to put on makeup Just need to do like Isuzu showed me There! I'm all ready now.,3369
Kinu,Come! I will determine whether your hand is good enough or not!,3370
Kinu,That's it? I've still got the demon card in my hand!,3370
Kinu,Dammit! You've ruined my tights and skirt!,3371
Kinugasa,Health comes first!,3371
Kinugasa,I'm not sure if Aoba is getting enough rest Please make sure to check up on her!,3372
Kinugasa,Work hard play hard! That's the secret to a happy life!,3372
Kinugasa,Everyone! Stay alert protect yourself and don't be reckless!,3373
Kinugasa,Everyone don't let your guard down just because we won!,3373
Kinugasa,We need to call a meeting and review this performance,3374
Kinugasa,Don't panic. Get into formation!,3374
Kinugasa,It's not like I care what you do,3375
Kinugasa,Don't be too hard on my sister She actually has a lot of guilt buried in her heart.,3375
Kinugasa,I don't really like lecturing people but I've gotten used to lecturing my sister and you don't seem to mind. Eh? You actually it? Then I guess I'll keep it up,3376
Kinugasa,"(On your desk you found a box of chocolates on top of an edition of the port newspaper folded neatly. The back of the box reads ""My sister worked hard on this one so you should read it! Also enjoy the chocolates! Love Kinugasa"").",3376
Kirov,Neither fate nor evil can hamper our ambitions!,3377
Kirov,The strong must always march onward. Holding the line is what the weak do.,3377
Kirov,Glory is what sustains and strengthens us and is what will leave our mark on history.,3378
Kirov,I march onward in the name of a tomorrow where everyone is safe and smiling.,3378
Kirov,You have mail. Read it through at once. The more comrades the better. Always.,3379

Kirov,Hear me! I am Kirov!,3382
Kirov,No! I am far far from finished!,3382
Kirov,It pains me to say but I no longer consider you my comrade.,3383
Kirov,I will always watch over you. Should you ever lose your way I will be the hand that shoves you back on the right path. Only look ahead never stop advancing!,3383
Kirov,To fight not just for your motherland but also for your soulmate that is what love is I understand it now. Passion is the fuel of my fighting spirit. And as long as I have you nothing is impossible!,3384
Kirov,What's on the itinerary today? If there's anything that requires me to uplift the spirits of our comrades I'm all in!,3384
Kirov,Having that said it isn't inconceivable that war devolves into attrition. In such cases we must be able to adapt to changes,3385
Kirov,Let me tell you this— never underestimate the eyes and ears of the Northern Parliament!,3385
Kirov,Hmm I would like you to be a bit more mindful of the rules.,3386
Kirov,One's individual leadership abilities are hardly as important as the will to stand side-by-side with one's comrades. In this regard you have excelled without a doubt.,3386
Kirov,Don't be nervous. Make yourself at home and relax.,3387
Kirov,Hmm I should find a way to improve my special blend somehow,3387
Kirov,Drinking coffee in tandem with listening to music is the most effective way to combat drowsiness. Let us start with a song that kindles your fighting spirit!,3388
Kirov,The weather is splendid today. Perfect for some outdoor exercise. Change my outfit? All I need put on is a pair of shoes.,3388
Kirov,You want to talk about coffee? I know countless facts and trivia about it. Go on ask me something.,3389
Kirov,Here taste my signature blend of coffee. It has a dash of vodka to keep you on your toes.,3389
Kirov,Bystreye! Yet more enemies of the Revolution lurk in the shadows!,3390
Kirov,Did Kronshtadt flank our mark already? She sure loves doing the flashy stuff,3390
Kirov,Come on hold on tight! We're about to blow this joint!,3391
Kirov,Drop your weapons!,3391
Kirov,Keep your eyes on the greater goal! Do not let our comrades' sacrifices blind you with rage!,3392
Kirov,Never overestimate your physical ability. That is a skill – one that has been built on the learnings of countless people over centuries.,3392
Kirov,Why not try this yourself Allen? Same for you there – yes the Sakura Empire girl. I'll reposition the bar for you so don't be scared.,3393
Kirov,Hah! Be awed at the sight of my athletic skill!,3393
Kirov,Look out! Phew. Be careful – a collision from this height seriously hurts.,3394
Kirov,I can hardly believe my new record made it next to your victory in the port newspaper Actually that is something of an affront to you,3394
Kisaragi,Eek! You scared me I thought a wolf was coming,3395
Kisaragi,I'm jealous of Mutsuki,3395
Kisaragi,Being alone with strangers is so scary,3396
Kisaragi,Eek! That feels a little weird,3396
Kisaragi,The older girls have returned They look so happy,3397
Kisaragi,Can I save everyone now?,3397
Kisaragi,Planes get away from me!,3398
Kisaragi,U-um I'm sorry!,3398

Kisaragi,I'm gonna do my best!,3403
Kitakaze,Those who lead upon the battlefield must also carry their own blade Worry not this one is not heavy at all.,3403
Kitakaze,My Akizuki-class sisters have always taken good care of me. I Kitakaze swear to meet their expectations and will work hard to protect everyone.,3404
Kitakaze,I prefer strategizing and leading from the rear over fighting in the frontlines B-but I’m perfectly capable of fighting head on.,3404
Kitakaze,True power comes from the strength of one’s convictions. It would behoove you to not underestimate my abilities!,3405
Kitakaze,Being small has its advantages Heheh. For example don’t even try to hit me in a game of dodgeball!,3405
Kitakaze,Hmm The responsibility of cleaning up your conduct weighs heavily upon me but please cease your crass behavior.,3406
Kitakaze,Let’s check the mail. I have a feeling that something good has happened!,3406
Kitakaze,Even after gaining power I Kitakaze shall keep a clear head.,3407
Kitakaze,The enemy’s movements are clear as day! Everyone follow me!,3407
Kitakaze,A single victory is nothing to be proud of. Let us prepare for the next battle.,3408
Kitakaze,Impossible h-how did I miscalculate?,3408
Kitakaze,My single strike shall seal your fate!,3409
Kitakaze,It’s not wise to swim against the current but we have no choice now!,3409
Kitakaze,Hmm you’re curious about the little one? Very well perhaps I will give you a demonstration when I get the chance.,3410
Kitakaze,I’m not good with the dark. I Kitakaze shall slowly follow behind you!,3410
Kitakaze,Wh-whoa?! You scared me What am I doing out here in the middle of the night? I was just trying to deliver your Valentine's chocolate Um I wasn't purposely trying to walk through a dark corridor so I would appreciate some help here,3411
Kitakaze,I'd like to make chocolate and give it to you as soon as the clock strikes midnight but I fear the dark. But that problem is solved as long as you're already with me! Wait it's already past midnight? Can I give you my chocolate soon then?,3411
Kiyonami,Ugh C-could you please not stare so much?,3412
Kiyonami,I feel safe around Yuugure. I enjoy playing and having sleepovers with her. I wish I had more friends like her,3412
Kiyonami,I'm always doing my best trying to catch up to everyone S-so please don't ever leave me behind okay?,3413
Kiyonami,Hoppy is cute isn't he? Ehehe~ He's always there with me when I go to bed.,3413
Kiyonami,The commission team just returned to port. Umm I think we should go check on them,3414
Kiyonami,Hoppy and I think we got a little stronger,3414
Kiyonami,I-I'm supposed to give orders?!  Whuah?! C-come on everyone!,3415
Kiyonami,I-I got first place? Y-you're not just joking right?,3415
Kiyonami,Ugh S-stay away!,3416
Kiyonami,W-we will do this together Hoppy!,3416
Kiyonami,I-I'm not going to give up!,3417
Kiyonami,Will we really be able to be together forever from now on? That's great! N-now I learned from Yuugure that the next thing I should do is close my eyes and wait for you to do something right? O-okay!,3417
Kiyonami,"S-sorry to keep you waiting Yuugure and I picked out this outfit together. She said it ""looked very Christmassy"" but it doesn't look weird right?  Ugh",3418
Kiyonami,All these warm lights at Christmas make me feel at ease I wish it was Christmas all year round,3418
Kiyonami,Sometimes Hoppy is on his own but we always go to bed together at night.,3419
Kiyonami,Y-you'll make my hood come undone Ugh,3419
Kiyonami,Well done on the last sortie. W-would you like a snack? I have gingerbread cookies and Christmas cake,3420
Kongou,Have you had enough rest? The fleet now awaits your orders.,3420
Kongou,The only value of war is the peace that follows it. I implore you to never forget this.,3421
Kongou,I take myself too seriously? No you take yourself too lightly!,3421
Kongou,Horns? Oh these things? They're just decorations on the hat. I wouldn't look much like a member of the Sakura Empire without them right?,3422
Kongou,Wh-what is it!? An emergency!?,3422
Kongou,Hey you don't tell me you've been subjecting my sisters to such depravity as well!?,3423
Kongou,Do I need to go do it myself?,3423
Kongou,Excellent! We're one step closer towards our ultimate victory.,3424
Kongou,Adjust your strategies in accordance with the new information.,3424
Kongou,Good work out there. Were you able to achieve your tactical goals?,3425
Kongou,Phew another trump card to add to my hand.,3425
Kongou,All units battle formations!,3426
Kongou,To be victorious is to be elegant!,3426
Kongou,Please rest at ease. This situation can still be salvaged.,3427
Kongou,Press the attack!,3427
Kongou,Now is the time to make our comeback!,3428
Kongou,You do not deserve victory!,3428
Kongou,Will Zuikaku be fine on her own? Mm I'll watch her from here. From this distance she probably won't notice me,3429
Kongou,I've heard that people are most likely to reveal their sentiments at twilight I wonder if you're also like this?,3429
Kongou,Since you've put so much effort into pursuing me so passionately it is only fitting that I give you the proper respect. Come you've earned my hand.,3430
Kongou,"(Kongou gave you a box of matcha chocolate treats. They go well with both western and eastern varieties of tea vaguely reminiscent of the refined lady who made them for you. She commented: ""Well? A fitting gift coming from me wouldn't you say?"")",3430
Kongou,I'm used to always going out with my sisters so to be able to spend time with you outside is rather novel for me.,3431
Kongou,You're awestruck by my beauty? Hehe something as obvious as that needs not even be said~,3431
Kongou,You perhaps you're going to need a remedial course in basic etiquette.,3432
Kongou,Good work in your sorties today. If you're hungry I don't mind splitting my dango with you.,3432
Kongou,Such a tasteless rabble!,3433
Kongou,Have you rested enough? Let's get back to work as gracefully as always.,3433
Kongou,This operating system is the fruit of Akashi and the others' hard work. Would you like to try it out Actually I guess it's best if you don't. Hehehe.,3434
Kongou,This syringe filled with Manjuu plushies is an advertising prop but isn't it quite adorable? Hehe~,3434
Kongou,In a way saving lives directly like this feels more fulfilling than fighting enemies on the battlefield.,3435
Kongou,Oh? Would a different pose be better?,3435
Kongou,Walking with you and taking in the scenery is quite pleasant actually. Say how about showing me that vantage point with an apparently exquisite view Hiei spoke of earlier?,3436
Kongou,This outing has reaffirmed to me the reason why we fight – to restore peace to all the world.,3436
Kongou,Kirishima made this charm in her home economics class. It's quite well-made don't you think?,3437
Kongou,It seems the manjuus fell asleep. Heehee seeing their adorable at-rest faces somehow makes me think of my sisters.,3437
Kongou,Oh do I have a petal caught in my hair?,3438
Kongou,Excuse me have you even considered how you're going to explain yourself to the Morals Committee?,3438
Kongou,The fruits of missions form the foundation of victory as someone wise once said.,3439
Kongou,Splendid work. I'd imagine Haruna went off to see her clubmates As for me? I suppose I'm doing the same this very moment my fellow going-straight-home clubmate.,3439
Kongou,It appears the commission team has returned. Shall we treat them to the tea I bought from the school canteen?,3440
Kongou,I excel in both theory and practice!,3440
Kongou,Ah the tailwind of victory. The very definition of envigorating is it not?,3441
Kongou,There is a number of school-related romantic things I hope to try at least once. For instance walking home with my beloved or making a lunch box and savouring it together Oh silly me I've already done those! Heehee,3441
Kronshtadt,Morning Comrade. I always warmly welcome one who practices punctuality. Hmm? The workday hasn't begun yet?,3442
Kronshtadt,My comrades should be contacting me soon. Let me open my– Huh? Don't move! Comrade?! Don't you know to knock before you enter? You already knocked? Oh. I see,3442
Kronshtadt,I left a note on your desk with a summary of all of today's tasks Comrade. What? You can't read my handwriting? Fine then I'll read it out for you. Let's see This says,3443
Kronshtadt,Who am I making such frequent calls to you ask? Be patient – you'll learn in due time.,3443
Kronshtadt,I never repeat something I've explained before. The more information is repeated the greater the risk of leaks Hmm? You didn't catch that? Okay as I was saying,3444
Kronshtadt,Strange My transceiver isn't working. How am I supposed to contact my comrades now? Screw it brute force it is Gah! It burst into smoke!,3444
Kronshtadt,What's essential during stealth missions is that you leave no trace. What this means is: before you go in cannons booming you should first create an even bigger boom to distract from– Huh? That's not how you do it?,3445
Kronshtadt,If you need my assistance just come forth and ask for it Comrade.,3445
Kronshtadt,I will not tolerate you – or anyone else – mistreating me Stop that right now!,3446
Kronshtadt,"Comrade what are you ""Returning my efforts with intimacy?"" I I see You've quite the straightforward methodology. I'll be doing the same the next time.",3446
Kronshtadt,I've compiled a list of all available missions. Strike them through one by one as you complete them Comrade.,3447
Kronshtadt,Your efficiency in completing missions is quite admirable Comrade Goodness you completed another just as I said that!,3447
Kronshtadt,You have a new message. Read it and I'll dispose of the letter afterwards if it's of a confidential nature. I'll ensure there's no trace left of it.,3448
Kronshtadt,Huh?! Oh it's just you. You put yourself in great danger by suddenly approaching me from behind. At least call out to me first Don't be ridiculous! You didn't startle me!,3448
Kronshtadt,So the commission team has returned. Exactly when the report said they would.,3449
Kronshtadt,Who could pass on more firepower am I right?,3449
Kronshtadt,Comrades! We march towards victory heads held high!,3450
Kronshtadt,Hahah! Victory is determined not by random chance but by a cascade of certainties.,3450
Kronshtadt,It's all my fault this happened! Dammit I apologize for my poor judgment!,3451
Kronshtadt,I've found your weakness!,3451
Kronshtadt,Do not panic! Focus! Focus!,3452
Kronshtadt,If you hope to gain my trust you're putting in quite a lackluster effort Comrade.,3452
Kronshtadt,"So I did some research into your past before coming here Comrade Oh please. You can infer what I found based on the fact I'm conversing with you right now and addressing you with the word ""Comrade.",3453
Kronshtadt,One person can only do so much alone. I have my comrades to thank for having made it this far. Likewise Comrade if you need my assistance I'm absolutely willing to give it.,3453
Kronshtadt,I have no issue giving something greater than intel to those I consider as trustworthy as you Comrade. But by accepting it you may be inviting danger into your life. Are you prepared for that hmm?,3454
Kronshtadt,"Our relationship goes beyond mere ""trust"" as I'm sure you know Comrade. So ahem Allow me to give you something purer more intense and unquestionably greater than my trust – my love! Wh-why are you laughing?!",3454
Kronshtadt,Oaths and ceremonies? I've no need for such grand wastes of time. We have but one thing to do once you've slid on this ring. Close your eyes Comrade and forever memorize what I am about to do!,3455
Kronshtadt,Good to see you Comrade. I've been waiting for you. Th-the reason I waited here was uh so nobody would spy on me. That's it.,3455
Kronshtadt,I just received a call from my comrades. It was all good news. I'll send you the important details later Comrade.,3456
Kronshtadt,You struggle to read my handwriting? Well if even you can't parse it that means it's a well-encrypted message. Ahahahah!,3456
Kronshtadt,Thanks Rossiya. I'll put this screw back where it Wait where did you find this?,3457
Kronshtadt,My peers? Hmh it pains me to admit but this port is home to a number of people one cut above me when it comes to espionage.,3457
Kronshtadt,Y-your boldness is a league above even mine,3458
Kronshtadt,I've compiled all the pertinent mission info. Get out there and knock them out of the park!,3458
Kronshtadt,Mission complete. It delights me to see you giving it your all.,3459
Kronshtadt,Ah Comrade? There's no reason to fear for your safety just over saying hello. By now I've grown used to you approaching me from behind. Ahahah!,3459
Kronshtadt,Dammit I must've gone overboard,3460
Kronshtadt,Take this transceiver. It connects to a highly secure channel no one but you and me knows about. Use it whenever I'm not around and you need help have something on your mind want to go on a date or just have a chat. I'll be there for you anytime anywhere!,3460
Kronshtadt,Listen up assholes! We have you surrounded! I'm Kronshtadt squad leader of the Northern Parliament Special Forces! You have only one option: come out with your hands in the air and surrender!,3461
Kronshtadt,The perimeter has been secured Comrade. Should I brief you on the situation or do you want to see for yourself?,3461
Kronshtadt,They've taken Manjuu hostages? God dammit then we've no other choice Squad prepare to storm the building!,3462
Kronshtadt,What's wrong with using indiscreet methods as means to an end? I quite like how much simpler this job is than information warfare.,3462
Kronshtadt,It was a smart move to set up a barricade. This way Kirov's squad can catch any suspects that try to flee the scene.,3463
Kronshtadt,Copy that Arkhangelsk is on the move. It won't be long before this is over.,3463
Kronshtadt,You turn the megaphone on with this button. Want to try it Comrade?,3464
Kronshtadt,Well well. Time to test how sturdy these handcuffs are by trying them on you. Heehee,3464
Kronshtadt,Arrest the suspects! Move!,3465
Kumano,Huh? Me takin' the battle seriously surprised you? Well yeah I get serious when the situation demands it.,3465

Kumano,Commission team's back yo. Don't got time for rhymes but let's go!,3469

Kumano,I'll return to port if it's the last thing I do!,3472
Kumano,You're lame you know that? Not tryin' to be mean or anything just saying. Listen I've got a couple ideas for how to unlamify you.,3472
Kumano,You'll finally hang with me? Hell yeah! Wish you would've just said so from the beginning! Anyway where we goin'? Y'know just the two of us~,3473
Kumano,"Uhh ""I take you to have and to hold from this day forward"" How'd the rest go? Agh screw it it's too long and I'm makin' a fool of myself in front of everyone! You don't mind if we bail and go straight to our room right darling?",3473
Kumano,Yo you payin' attention? Ya seriously don't get what it means when your girl goes outta her way to give ya chocolate on Valentine's? Lemme tell ya then. It means she loves you,3474
Kumano,This is too revealing? Meh not really~? I've seen submarines wearing more risqué stuff than this.,3474

Kumano,Hungry Suzuya? Wanna order home delivery?,3476
Kumano,Ahah! Is that your final answer?,3477
Kumano,You jelly Suzuya? 'Cause you sure look it! Haha~,3477
Kumano,Now I'm PISSED! I'm gonna beat the crap outta you!,3478
Kumano,Welcome to my unveiling! Now let's see how many songs you can last before you fall for me~ Hahahah,3478
Kumano,That's Mikuma? When'd she become so damn hot and stylish? Sheeeesh Even I'm swooning over here!,3479

Kumano,I'm gonna evade all their attacks and dance around the– Oww!,3481
Kursh,Morning boss. I was going to leave you a note before I left but decided to just tell you in person after all.,3482
Kursh,I'm used to working solo. Even if it doesn't snow here I can still cover up my tracks if I want to.,3482
Kursh,Hunters are loners by nature – only helpless prey form groups. I walk a solitary road for that reason.,3483
Kursh,Tactics? Those are a chore. I follow my gut instincts. Nothing can tamper with that.,3483
Kursh,Snow huh I love when it snows. Makes it easy to cover up my tracks. It's as though it was made for ambushing.,3484
Kursh,Something urgent? I'll do it if you want.,3484
Kursh,What are you trying to do?,3485
Kursh,Why are you acting like we're that close? I don't get you people,3485
Kursh,You need my help with this new mission? Fine you rest in the meanwhile. I'm not a team player.,3486
Kursh,Mission rewards have come in. Go check 'em. Everything that's there you've earned.,3486
Kursh,Left a letter for you on the desk. I don't care what it's about so check it yourself.,3487
Kursh,Oh you're back Did you win?,3487
Kursh,Commission completed. Enjoy the job-well-done party yourself – I'll pass.,3488
Kursh,The thrill of gaining power makes me crave more.,3488
Kursh,The hunt is on!,3489
Kursh,Ahh The smell of gunpowder and victory. Just what I like.,3489
Kursh,Urgh My hunt can't end in a place like this!,3490
Kursh,I'll rip you to shreds!,3490
Kursh,The thrill of walking the line between life and death Give me more more!,3491
Kursh,Stay away from me.,3491
Kursh,Swords become dull if not sharpened. It's why I still go back to the tundra and hunt like I used to – skills like swords need to be maintained.,3492
Kursh,I'm not so much a lone wolf I just choose not to get involved with people. I operate on efficiency and ruthlessness so I steer clear of cowards and weaklings for their sake not mine.,3492
Kursh,People say I'm cold but I just don't feel the need to pay attention to every little shift in other people's moods. Getting caught up in emotions is a waste of everyone's time.,3493
Kursh,Even though I've adapted to solitude I somehow don't feel repulsed when I'm around you. Maybe Maybe you've rubbed off on me.,3493
Kursh,You serious? You want ME the lone wolf of the tundras? Heheh. Let's see if you have what it takes to tame me.,3494
Kursh,Welcome back. What are we doing today? Work first of all? Fine. I'll wait here in the meanwhile.,3494
Kursh,Here to see me? 'kay. No need to cover my tracks Truth is I wanted to see you too.,3495
Kursh,I do things my way but if need be I'll follow your commands. I trust your better judgment.,3495
Kursh,The Northern Parliament's having a party? I don't mind liquor it's just Ah forget it. I'll go if only to make you look good. When it's time for chitchat back me up.,3496
Kursh,Those white tundras and snowy valleys still hold a special place in my heart. I'd happily take you with me to see them sometime.,3496
Kursh,I'm right here. I'm bad at reading emotions so if you need something just say it.,3497
Kursh,It's time I taught you who's the hunter and who's the prey.,3497
Kursh,If you really must,3498
Kursh,You've got new missions. I'll help you in the way I know best.,3498
Kursh,Mission complete. Hah we're starting to look like a team.,3499
Kursh,*sniff* I smell gunpowder on you but not blood. Good to know you're unharmed.,3499
Kursh,This steamy hot spring is a rather novel experience. I left a spot for you so come sit down already – Wait why haven't you taken your clothes off yet?,3500
Kursh,Am I cold? Not really. If I can handle an ice bath a hot spring is nothing. You on the other hand should be careful of the night breeze.,3500
Kursh,Seems the Sakura Empire has the most hot spring enthusiasts. Not that I don't want to bathe with them but as you know I'd rather be alone.,3501
Kursh,The hot steam causes the cold air to fog up impeding visibility and making this an ideal place to set up an ambush Heh. Don't worry. I'm right here.,3501
Kursh,How's the temperature? If you want I can turn up the heat using my rigging.,3502
Kursh,While I hate rubbing shoulders I can tolerate you being around.,3502
Kursh,You want to get up close and personal huh? Heheh.,3503
Kursh,A new mission just got handed down. Go ahead and take a look – we'll have plenty of time to relax later.,3503
Kursh,I left your letter in a less humid spot. Don't want your important papers getting wet do we?,3504
Kursh,Where have you been? You didn't want to pass out from dizziness? Don't worry about that. Worst case scenario I'll just carry you back home.,3504
Kursh,There's no reason I cannot go into battle like this. The hunt is on!,3505
Kursh,Seems I'm still wet behind the ears,3505
Kuybyshev,I'm not afraid of being hurt. If it means protecting you and the others I'll take that bargain every time. Heehee.,3506
Kuybyshev,Nnh I'm fine. Today's document review is another behemoth. Thank you for all you do.,3506
Kuybyshev,Believe in yourself. Your accomplishments in bringing peace to these blue seas are more than worthy.,3507
Kuybyshev,Worry not. I am here for you.,3507
Kuybyshev,"Tell me are you familiar with the phrase ""summary offense?",3508
Kuybyshev,I'm fine. Your concern is much appreciated.,3508
Kuybyshev,Unfinished missions await. If there's anything I can do to help don't hesitate.,3509
Kuybyshev,Back from another mission? Why don't you rest with a warm bowl of borscht?,3509
Kuybyshev,Your mail has arrived. Why don't you reply to it while the feelings behind them still burn?,3510
Kuybyshev,Welcome back. You got a little wet during that last battle didn't you? Best change your clothes before you catch cold. Here give me your hand.,3510
Kuybyshev,The commission team has returned. I'll escort them back to port.,3511
Kuybyshev,We must be ready for our next battle.,3511
Kuybyshev,Fear me! Then follow my lead!,3512
Kuybyshev,What a wonderful heart-warming victory.,3512
Kuybyshev,It doesn't matter if I fall as long as my comrades make it out!,3513
Kuybyshev,Can you take the heat?!,3513
Kuybyshev,Ugh! I must withstand this!,3514
Kuybyshev,Perhaps I must discipline you as Chapayev would.,3514
Kuybyshev,The port is chilly at night. You must have some reason for being here at this hour. Would you be willing to share why?,3515
Kuybyshev,Fancy meeting you here again. Aren't you cold? I don't just mean your body; I want your heart and mind to be warm and healthy evermore Heehee.,3515
Kuybyshev,Isn't the moon beautiful tonight? You know I only feel this heartwarming sensation when I'm with you. You've shared your worries and vulnerabilities with me I don't want to take my eyes off of you. Heehee but don't turn to me; keep your eyes fixed on the moon for just a while longer.,3516
Kuybyshev,Ouch! Sorry for making you wrap these bandages for me Don't worry about me. It's better if we go all-out during these exercises. I'm used to this anyway.,3516
Kuybyshev,Is something on your mind? I could Oh. You say you're just daydreaming? I see *sigh*,3517
Kuybyshev,Back straight! Fix that posture! Head up! Heehee there! Now this feels more like an outing.,3517
Kuybyshev,*blows* Ack! I forgot to move the tea out of the thermos O-oh ignore me! I don't burn that easily I swear haha,3518
Kuybyshev,I'm fine Oh that's not why you're touching me? H-heheh My mistake.,3518
Kuybyshev,This is a rather paltry reward Perhaps I should look into this?,3519
Kuybyshev,Such a passionate celebration. It's beyond warm—why I'd call it downright fiery! Heehee.,3519
Kuybyshev,We mustn't retreat! Ours is the final line of defense!,3520
Kuybyshev,Solving your problems and warming your bed are both my responsibilities Haha! I'm kidding. I do it all because I want to after all. Oh? That's not what you expected the punchline to be? Well,3520
Kuybyshev,Though they say spring has come the wintry wind has not yet left. Be careful you don't catch a cold okay?,3521
Kuybyshev,Oh you're curious about my bandages? I hit my head while I was decorating Sorry to worry you.,3521
Kuybyshev,The subtle serenity of life as winter the radiant merriment of fellowship as spring The Dragon Empery's music is so delightfully expressive.,3522
Kuybyshev,Speak up if you have any requests okay? Heehee!,3522
Kuybyshev,Why not kick back and enjoy the music? There's no need to overwork yourself today.,3523
Kuybyshev,Tighten up! This is a battlefield!,3523
Kuybyshev,I'm glad this victory was worthy of celebration.,3524
Kuybyshev,Can't sleep hm? Have some warm milk and put on classical music and I'm sure you'll drift right off. Today is a day to be with family so why don't I stay here with you until you're sound asleep? Heehee,3524
La_Galissonnière,Finally! You're back! I thought I was gonna rust up from boredom while you were gone. Gimme a task any task and I'll do it.,3525
La_Galissonnière,You lookin' to have some fun? You mean with me or my weapon?,3525
La_Galissonnière,Can't say I'm keen on planning stuff It's like you make a plan but it always changes y'know?,3526
La_Galissonnière,Touch me all you want! As long as you don't mind getting hurt.,3526
La_Galissonnière,"Listen unlike a certain someone from the Templar Knights ""dirty work"" is my specialty Wanna know more?",3527
La_Galissonnière,These missions are a pain? Well sorry to hear that? I can't exactly do 'em for you y'know.,3527
La_Galissonnière,Here letter for you. Better read it now 'cause it's not my problem if you lose it.,3528

La_Galissonnière,"Gotta say I still prefer working under Jean Bart rather than Algérie. Y'know it's that whole ""don't worry about anything other than slaughtering your enemies"" kind of feeling",3535
La_Galissonnière,Hm? Hmmmmm? Mmm Well whatever~,3536
La_Galissonnière,"There's not too much of ""that"" kind of work to do at this port huh Well as long as the Iris girls are safe and sound here then I can have fun without worrying about anything! Hehehe!",3536

La_Galissonnière,Putting on a costume and scaring people sounds pretty fun So that's what Halloween's all about huh? Makes my costume choice seem kinda out-of-place though,3543
La_Galissonnière,"Am I supposed to go ""meeoow?",3544
La_Galissonnière,This lingerie won't stop me from gettin' my hands dirty if I need to y'know.,3544

Lützow,Need something? Wait Now's a bad time. I've got urgent business. By that I mean: chat with me!,3557

Lützow,Need a hand there? All right. I could help you with not much it seems. I'll just take a nap instead.,3558

Lützow,Garlic? Crosses? Those don't work on me Those are meant to repel a vampire? Well then I'm throwing those weaknesses right out the window.,3561

Le_Malin,I wouldn't have signed up if I knew this was going to happen,3591
Le_Mars,To be honest I'm a little jealous of Forbin. Back then we both weren't able to move but she made more of the situation than me,3592
Le_Mars,Studying just isn't my strong suit I obviously can read all these words but they just don't make any sense to me when put together,3592

Le_Mars,It's just a flesh wound! I'll tough it out!,3597
Le_Mars,To be an outstanding knight it's not enough to just have the strength to protect others. You must also become wise through learning! But I always start dozing off when I'm studying *yawn*,3598
Le_Mars,Um I haven't learned what I'm supposed to do at a place like this yet Ah um! In any case p-please continue to take good care of me in the future!,3598

Le_Mars,Now for a victory pose! Hey! Wait for meeee!,3600

Le_Mars,If you underestimate me just because I'm lightly equipped I'll gladly teach you a lesson~!,3602

Le_Mars,School life is all about running track under the warm sun am I right!?,3603
Le_Mars,Huh? Forbin's heading this way with a pile of notebooks? Um is there a good hiding place around here—,3603
Le_Mars,The wind doesn't scare me!,3604
Le_Mars,I don't need a massage right now,3604
Le_Mars,Uh oh I can't get anything in this book to stick in my head,3605
Le_Mars,I can't do this Reading books about etiquette puts me right to sleep Huh? You're willing to be my practice partner? That'd be a huge help!,3605
Le_Mars,Phew I finally managed to finish making my rounds I was so nervous my body was stiff as a rock but you looked like you were totally in your element That's amazing I tell you!,3606
Le_Mars,Um this is how you're supposed to hold the champagne right?,3606
Le_Mars,Um is this also a part of my training?,3607
Le_Mars,It's probably because I got a good warm-up in. Hehe~,3607
Le_Téméraire,Vas-y! Come on the day's work is only beginning!,3608
Le_Téméraire,Everyone here is so nice but there are some who seem hard to strike up a conversation with,3608
Le_Téméraire,I made friends from several different camps yesterday! Ehehe~,3609
Le_Téméraire,If everyone all got along then we wouldn't have any wars!,3609

Le_Téméraire,Heheh~ Did you see me just now?,3614
Le_Téméraire,Ehh? I lost?,3614
Le_Téméraire,H-huh? Where am I?!,3615
Le_Téméraire,I'm gonna take a stroll around the port today~ Maybe I can make some new friends!,3615
Le_Téméraire,A relationship more important than friendship lovers? But I don't know what it means to be lovers Huh? Just do what we always do?,3616
Le_Téméraire,Behold this chocolate cake the fruit of me and Opie's combined efforts! We made little chocolate versions of us to go on it too! You'd feel too bad eating them? F-fair Maybe we went a little too hard &gt;&lt;,3616
Le_Téméraire,Today's the day of the big beach volleyball meet! My friends and I are aiming for the top spot!,3617
Le_Téméraire,"Opiniâtre are you busy practicing your ""magic"" again? Since we came all the way out here you might as well have some fun",3617
Le_Téméraire,Huh a crab? Ehh?? It was just right there Where'd it run off to?,3618
Le_Téméraire,Awawawa! Th-the strings are coming loose!,3618
Le_Téméraire,Huh? We're getting work on our day off?,3619
Le_Téméraire,How do I look? These pajamas are super cute aren't they? Ehehe I really like this one! It even matches with Opiniâtre's!,3619
Le_Téméraire,I got this lollipop from Mutsuki earlier! Oh and keep it a secret from Dunkerque okay? I'm hoping she'll make one for me later~,3620
Le_Téméraire,I can't sleep now there's still tons of stuff I wanna do before bed. No staying up late allowed? Aww Fine then I'll lie down right now!,3620
Le_Téméraire,Hang on where's my Manjuu plushie gone? Oh! It was hiding in the pillow!,3621
Le_Téméraire,This Manjuu plushie is so squishy! It feels super comfy to cuddle with!,3621
Le_Téméraire,Th-th-th-that's not something you should be squishing!,3622
Le_Terrible,I have no interest in fighting pointless battles but there seem to be some individuals here who place excessive pride in their speed Of course I was more than glad to put them in their place. More importantly I made quite a few friends in the process. Not too bad right?,3622
Le_Terrible,That little incident I had with Le Malin? Yes I've already apologized to her but her mind seemed to be on something else,3623
Le_Terrible,You may pray to the Holy Iris or offer me a confession in person. Speak your piece.,3623
Le_Terrible,Please refrain from touching my hat.,3624
Le_Terrible,Here are the materials you've requested as well as the tea and light meal. Please note that the tea may be a bit hot. Hmm? It's cooled down?,3624
Le_Terrible,Coins oil and supplies I wonder if the rewards for this commission will also be abundant.,3625
Le_Terrible,What is it that you are fighting for?,3625
Le_Terrible,The warriors of Iris Libre must not falter.,3626
Le_Terrible,Bloom forth hallowed Iris!,3626
Le_Terrible,The Holy Iris will protect us!,3627
Le_Terrible,If you wish to make a confession better to turn to the Cardinal rather than to me.,3627
Le_Terrible,You're here neither for prayers nor confessions? I see. In that case I'll also have to find something else to do to pass the time Hmm hmm,3628
Le_Terrible,If I was to cross the threshold of death's door one day would you pull me back–– Hmm I suppose that question's a bit too easy. I'm not trying to toy around with you I simply wanted to hear how you feel. Heheh~,3628
Le_Terrible,Sorry to make you buy a ring for me but I can't deny these feelings any longer–– Heh heheh Ahahaha~ Yes with this sacred ritual no longer will I be teasing you. Indeed from now on I pledge myself to you fully and forever.,3629
Le_Terrible,You look to be in high spirits today. So what do you need me to do next?,3629
Le_Terrible,A tea party with my sisters? I don't know about that H-hey it's not that I don't want to go But what if the tea is too hot,3630
Le_Terrible,If you have a mission that requires speed just leave it to me. That's one of my fortes after all.,3630
Le_Terrible,Want to head to somewhere high up after you're done with work? I'd like to understand what it feels like to be a bird soaring freely through the skies.,3631
Le_Terrible,This is also one of my weaknesses.,3631
Le_Terrible,The mission rewards are right here. Heh heh~ I love the way you look when you're pushing yourself to the limit~,3632
Le_Terrible,Accept your divine punishment!,3632
Le_Terrible,How's that? Look what I in all my grace and elegance have done in your name.,3633
Le_Terrible,Le Malin Le Triomphant We'll be together forever Zzzzz,3633
Le_Terrible,Le Triomphant You're not the most photogenic sleeper,3634
Le_Terrible,Nooo I'm going to get pranked Ehehe I won't hold it against you though so please,3634
Le_Terrible,But if you could stop at scribbling on my face that'd be nice,3635
Le_Terrible,The missions We haven't finished them all yet,3635
Le_Terrible,We have mission rewards waiting for us,3636
Le_Terrible,Please remember to check your mail,3636
Le_Terrible,Zzzz Black tea should be left until it's a bit cooler than room temperature,3637
Le_Terrible,Our commission went wonderfully I saw that in my dream,3637
Le_Terrible,It'd be nice if I could get stronger after waking up,3638
Le_Terrible,Well then I guess I'll fight,3638
Le_Terrible,*Yawn* I'm still a bit sleepy I can't even properly savor the aftertaste of victory like this Zzzzz,3639
Le_Terrible,I knew it I'm just not good enough Unlike some of those Eagle Union destroyers,3639
Le_Terrible,Zzzzz,3640
Le_Terrible,For someone not accustomed to strenuous exercise such as myself I prefer to let the ocean's waves rock me back and forth.,3640
Le_Terrible,Miss Ark Royal? Hmm you're asking if she comes across as helpful or troublesome? Perhaps a bit of both I must say,3641
Le_Terrible,If a big wave comes Hmm Uhh That's probably not going to bode well for me,3641
Le_Terrible,If you find it too hot why not take off another layer~? Hehe~,3642
Le_Terrible,My oh my~,3642
Le_Terrible,Oh it appears the commission fleet has returned.,3643
Le_Triomphant,My I see you've returned? What shall your orders be today? I am ready to accept any assignment - commission or sortie!,3643
Le_Triomphant,If you have any questions feel free to ask away. I will respond to each one.,3644
Le_Triomphant,My sword and shield? Oh they stop feeling heavy after a while. Well I also am quite strong.,3644
Le_Triomphant,If I was with my sisters at that time would things have happened differently?,3645
Le_Triomphant,Whether someone is friend or foe is not something set in stone.,3645
Le_Triomphant,New missions have been issued.,3646
Le_Triomphant,It feels nice to be celebrated by someone you don't know doesn't it?,3646
Le_Triomphant,Why don't you let me handle the next one? I'll get it done the fastest.,3647
Le_Triomphant,In the name of Iris Libre let us break their lines!,3647
Le_Triomphant,Sometimes things like this can happen as well,3648
Le_Triomphant,Pour la liberté!,3648
Le_Triomphant,The outcome still isn't set in stone!,3649
Le_Triomphant,Don't you think Noblesse Oblige is an elegant idea?,3649
Le_Triomphant,In order to realize their ideals and ambitions even family members may part ways and eventually meet each other on the battlefield It's so tragic,3650
Le_Triomphant,Familiarity with hardship and suffering cultivates an appreciation of life and death. At least that's what I think,3650
Leander,Sometimes I have to endure things I don't like huh,3651
Leander,I'm gonna work a little harder,3651
Leander,Let's go everyone. Be careful not to get hurt!,3652
Leander,This victory belongs to everyone!,3652
Leander,I've caused you trouble,3653
Leander,just the right spot!,3653
Leander,Always be by your side is it? I understand. If it's alright I'll happily stay by your side~,3654
Leander,The purpose of Valentine's Day is to give chocolate to the people important to you as a way of showing gratitude. I think I took a bit longer than I should have but I got there in the end.! Hehehe ,3654
Leander,Though I miss the place where I used to live the presence of the four seasons here makes it feel like home.,3655
Leander,Compared to me my sisters have much more colourful personalities *Sigh*,3655
Leipzig,Eek! I think I saw something,3656
Leipzig,I'll I'll try my best!,3656
Leipzig,Is this training for learning how to not faint? I'll.. see what I can do,3657
Leipzig,Uuu I really won't be able to move like this what should I do?,3657
Leipzig,Ahh~! I'm so nervous I could faint,3658
Leipzig,F-Fishy helped me make my chocolate this time around! If you're wondering how well he taste-tested it measured the ingredients and took me to the infirmary when I felt ill It's all thanks to him that the chocolate came out tasting really good.,3658

Leonardo_da_Vinci,Dancing among the beautiful flora and fauna makes me feel like I'm becoming one with nature.,3679

Leonardo_da_Vinci,Do you reckon I could fly with these wings if I scaled them up? Imagine the midair dances I could do. They'd be stunning!,3681

Littorio,That Veneto she's not half bad for a fleet flagship However if she wants to move forward she must learn from me. Hahahaha!,3701
Littorio,There are two kinds of people in the world: those who are Littorio and those who are not.,3701
Littorio,There is no denying that though battleships once ruled the seas aircraft have ushered in the beginning of a new era. This is a fact that not even I can refute.,3702
Littorio,Chasing after others is a novel and interesting experience is it not?,3702
Littorio,Contact your superiors for me. Tell them these paltry rewards do not satisfy me.,3703
Littorio,It appears there are more letters addressed to me than to you.,3703
Littorio,Your ability to see my true potential proves that your perception is superb.,3704
Littorio,Did the enemy wander here by mistake? That's too bad for them.,3704
Littorio,Trying to oppose me was your greatest mistake.,3705
Littorio,Defeated? No we are simply not victorious yet.,3705
Littorio,Arrivederci!,3706
Littorio,Don't give in yet Pugliese system!,3706
Littorio,You want my autograph? I will give you it for free as a special favor Just kidding. Hahaha!,3707
Littorio,When you give to the world the world gives back to you. So put your mind at ease. Pursue the object of your desire and grab hold of it. Because I Littorio deem you worthy.,3707
Littorio,This is what Veneto told me-People with charisma should work to raise each other up not drag each other down with bitter fighting. Hehe. Indeed this is applicable to the two of us for we are drawn to each other due the other's charisma. As for seeing how much higher we can raise each other up-why don't I start by giving you this chocolate? I'll look forward to how you respond to my feelings.,3708
Littorio,The reason I invited you to watch me make chocolate? I thought you wouldn't be satisfied with just receiving it. After all an experience isn't just the end result but also everything leading up to it. Now peel your eyes and prepare to be amazed!,3708
Littorio,A visit to the beach with me? Then you must try your hardest to stand out. Otherwise the eyes of the world will be on me alone.,3709
Littorio,Veneto? Don't expect much from her No I don't mean her swimsuit. She's the type that would spend the entire day building a sand Colosseum.,3709
Littorio,The Mediterranean Sea is thing of beauty in summer but this sea surpasses it in sheer bustle. I prefer this one; it lets my glamor reach the hearts and minds of many more.,3710
Littorio,What? That damned Veneto is going to play beach volleyball?!  I must help her to ensure the Sardegna Empire's glory remains unsullied,3710
Littorio,Welcome to Littorio's personal suite. Are you here to issue me a challenge of who can romance the most girls? Hahahah I'm joking of course! There'd be no fun in a game I would win every single time.,3711
Littorio,As proud as we are of our wonderful Sardegnian thermae and as befittingly charming it is when Veneto conducts foreign relations from them the fact remains that diplomacy should be left to the pros. Wouldn't you agree?,3711
Littorio,There are two kinds of parties in the world: those with Littorio in attendance and those without.,3712
Littorio,Let us have a grand toast to the triumphant return of our hero. Alla salute!,3712
Littorio,Hello there. You'll have to forgive the loungewear; I have scarcely any reason to wear extravagant clothes in my private space away from the public eye.,3713
Littorio,You certainly took your sweet time It's not every day I let a person see the casual side of me you know.,3713
Littorio,As a leader part of my duty to my people is to make the decisions that lead to tranquil days where everyone may rest easy.,3714
Littorio,Come on now stop and smell the roses. Care for a cup of cappuccino? Actually no it would keep you awake through naptime.,3714
Littorio,Veneto is a tad too formal wouldn't you agree? She really ought to do like me and take time to unwind more often.,3715
Littorio,My cardigan is made of woven silk. You can appreciate its quality just from touching it no?,3715
Littorio,When put before a stunning treasure few could be satisfied with only watching from afar.,3716
Littorio,Look who's back. Hang up your coat and make yourself at home. Then I can get comfortable too.,3716

London,Happy Valentine's Day Your Excellency. It's a given that I've made chocolate just as it's a given that you're anticipating it. Perhaps we both take this tradition for granted but I'm fine with that. When sheer bliss is the norm what more can one ask for?,3731
London,Um Your Excellency could you please stop staring at me like you don't recognise me? I didn't think that I'd get a new look for my retrofit either But don't you think it's rather cute?,3731

Maillé_Brézé,Stunning hair ornament am I right?,3787

Maillé_Brézé,New mail The information inside is sure to be of paramount significance!,3788
Maillé_Brézé,The commission team hath returned! Heheh. The rewards would've been greater if you'd entrusted the job to a Templar Knight like me,3789

Mainz,Achievements? Let's start racking them up today.,3803
Mainz,What do you think you're doing! Adding milk to coffee is nothing short of blasphemy! The same goes for sugar!!!,3803
Mainz,I can't believe it though this room is so large it doesn't even have a coffee maker!,3804
Mainz,If only I were constructed in the Great War instead of being incarnated in this form I wonder how much I would have been able to do I guess thinking about it doesn't help.,3804
Mainz,What's wrong? Do you want me to comfort you?,3805
Mainz,Perfect. I can finish testing my guns by firing them at you.,3805
Mainz,Are you going to neglect all the missions?,3806
Mainz,How long are you planning on ignoring the mission rewards?,3806
Mainz,There's new mail. There's no way you've forgotten right?,3807
Mainz,My equipment needs maintenance too.,3807
Mainz,The girls who went on commissions are returning. I'll be leaving my seat for a bit.,3808
Mainz,Hm. Let's test this out in a real battle.,3808
Mainz,Don't get in my way.,3809
Mainz,An expected outcome given that I am here.,3809
Mainz,Hm. I'll consider this as valuable practical experience.,3810
Mainz,Now's the time! Begin firing!,3810
Mainz,Ugh to think that my equipment wouldn't work?!,3811
Mainz,Because I was born into this world I shall accomplish something. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to face those who designed me.,3811
Mainz,At one point I fought to prove myself. However I now fight for your sake. I want to prove to everyone else that you are a sufficiently reliable person.,3812
Mainz,You don't know what this is? It's coffee chocolate. Frankly speaking this is already a compromise for me. Anything below this level of quality would be completely unacceptable! Not in terms of coffee but in terms of a chocolate meant f-for you,3812
Mainz,Mm. I've set up a tea party of sorts for you. Enjoy this pairing of coffee roasted and extracted from the highest quality beans and chocolate flavored with that very coffee. I made all of this from scratch. Hopefully you can infer my feelings from that,3813
Mainz,Here's some fresh coffee. I've made it to your taste.,3813
Mainz,I'll be going to get the mission rewards,3814
Mainz,You've got new mail. Leave the rest to me.,3814
Mainz,Für den Kommandant!,3815
Mainz,Ah! Changed already? Just wait a minute No you don't have to leave. I'm almost done.,3815
Mainz,I wouldn't have minded waiting longer. After all I know you're not the type to forget a promise.,3816
Mainz,Blücher tried to wear her rigging to the bath but Eugen and I managed to stop her. Seems like Hipper didn't want to get in with us though,3816
Mainz,Nngh It's hard to tie this sash tight enough. But if it's too loose,3817
Mainz,They didn't let me bring a coffee machine into the bathhouse but Heh I did get to set it up outside. Black of course.,3817
Mainz,The mirror? I'd assume it's fogged up from the steam. Look at my reflection you say? What do you Oh. *blushes*,3818
Mainz,W-wait! Don't do that or else!,3818
Mainz,A mission huh? Let's put it off for now. It'll still be there after we take a break.,3819
Mainz,Finished your missions already? Then that gives us more time to kick back.,3819
Mainz,You have new mail. I told them to leave it in your office so we can check it later.,3820
Mainz,I guess I got too comfortable,3820
Makinami,C'mon stop being so blue and be positively positive!,3821
Makinami,You've heard I've only been on transport missions? No I-I've totally fought before too!,3821

Makinami,Here's a present from me~!,3827
Makinami,C-could we retreat?!,3828
Makinami,Hmph. Leave me alone.,3828
Makinami,It'd be a shame to not go out and play on a sunny day like this! Right? Let's head out~,3829
Makinami,Fine I'll start looking where I'm going and not run and jump so much Doesn't it get boring for you always walking like that?,3829
Makinami,I-is this a bride carry?! H-hehehe But I still think I prefer your piggyback rides,3830
Makinami,If you ever get hurt I promise I'll carry YOU back home! So can you give me a piggyback ride now? Hehehe~,3830
Makinami,All right everything looks good! I'm super excited and my batteries are fully charged! I'm heading out~!,3831

Marco_Polo,The golden Dragon Empery I have countless stories of it to share if you'll only lend me an ear!,3879
Marco_Polo,Looking at the map This port is unbelievably small. Has the thought of expanding it never crossed your mind?,3880
Marco_Polo,For what have I been summoned?,3880
Marco_Polo,Tsk! Such boorish behavior,3881
Marco_Polo,New missions? Be magnificent and get them done in a jiffy okay? Chop-chop.,3881

Marco_Polo,You command a whole fleet of ships and you don't even try to use them to spread the Empire's– I mean your own glory? It truly baffles me.,3888
Marco_Polo,"You! What is the deal with you? I never said you should ""spread the glory of Marco Polo's name!"" You You You're too ambitious for your own good!",3889
Marco_Polo,A woman with great aspirations doesn't let commitments bind her. But for you I'll make an exception. And don't you dare vanish on me until your ambitions are realized!,3889

Marco_Polo,Hm-hm~ Have you no orders for your maid? You're hardly the authoritative master I'd imagined.,3891
Marco_Polo,I've been told many desire to be in a position where they can give you hands-on assistance – like a maid does. Which is to say: I am envied by everyone around me. Hehehe hehehehe~,3891
Marco_Polo,Is it not a maid's duty to issue a slap on the wrist when her master procrastinates? Hehehe! How magnificent that you understand!,3892
Marco_Polo,Routine tasks making meals greeting guests filing paperwork hatching plans doing battle I can perform anything you require!,3892
Marco_Polo,Hwaaah?!,3893
Marco_Polo,You've been given new missions. Fascinating how announcing that is part of a maid's duties,3893
Marco_Polo,I've left your letter right over there. It's as easy to reach as possibly can be.,3894
Marco_Polo,Where oh where is my master who refuses to delegate work to a maid? Here I've taken these duties upon myself in your stead.,3894

Marie_Rose,Hmm this swimsuit is pretty cute but isn't it a bit childish? In any case if you like it then it's all good!,3901
Marie_Rose,A photoshoot? That's fine with me! I'd like to take a lot of wonderful pictures! But I'm not going to strike any weird poses got it?,3901

Maryland,Mission rewards Darn what a waste of time.,3909
Maryland,When writing a reply back should I carry an anti-aircraft gun with me,3909
Maryland,Sigh staying in port is so boring,3910
Maryland,Even though commissions are an important part of the war but I'm just not interested in them.,3910
Maryland,I really wanna try to shoot a volley from my main gun right now,3911
Maryland,Dear opponents do NOT disappoint me!,3911
Maryland,Haha! This is just the appetizer before the main course!,3912
Maryland,No matter how many times it takes I will sink you again!,3912
Maryland,Now this is a fun battle!,3913
Maryland,A saying that I recently heard from my sister “Never protest your loyalty to the weak”.,3913
Maryland,I don't know who granted us the title of BIG SEVEN. But if those two keep mentioning it non-stop then the title should have some special meaning to it.,3914
Maryland,The war cannot be won by a single person. Without true sisters fighting alongside you and a reliable backline supporting you no matter how strong you are your defeat is inevitable!,3914
Maryland,Look into my eyes as my most trusted companions is it even necessary to use words to express the feelings I have for you in my heart?,3915
Maryland,You really treasure these strange rings do you? But since it's your decision I'll go with it! From now on I will protect you!,3915
Maryland,Just as much as I like you I hate having to leave the battlefield. And just to make chocolate of all things I'm Fighting Mary: a soldier not a damn chef so you'd better like it!,3916
Maryland,Who woulda thunk Washington would get bossed around by her sister. Wish Colorado was a bit more like Carolina. Not trying to badmouth my own sister but she's too much of a pushover. If you ask me she should just come out and say it if she loves you. That's how I'd do it.,3916
Massachusetts,Tell me when you're done inspecting.,3917
Massachusetts, You know I actually like this hair color. It's like that of a bald eagle isn't it?,3917
Massachusetts,You think my jacket is strange? This way I can feel the breeze hit my skin when out at sea though I love it.,3918
Massachusetts,You want someone to pamper you?  You want ME to?,3918
Massachusetts, If you'd move your body more you'd have fewer weird thoughts.,3919
Massachusetts,So many missions waiting on us,3919
Massachusetts,Ah the rewards have arrived Seems we can afford beef for dinner tonight.,3920
Massachusetts,I'll leave your letter here. Check it later.,3920
Massachusetts,You're back Did you get hurt? If anyone pokes fun at you we can talk about it.,3921
Massachusetts, Oh look. They've brought so much back. I'll go help them out.,3921
Massachusetts,I feel a bit different,3922
Massachusetts,Pretty tough aren't you? You won't cry if I hit you will you?,3922
Massachusetts,Sorry I got distracted,3923
Massachusetts,This one's really heavy.,3923
Massachusetts, So you want me to get serious?,3924
Massachusetts,How to get stronger? Uhh do some push-ups?  Not working for you?,3924
Massachusetts,Seeing you challenging yourself with things you can't do is interesting. It makes me want to explore my own limits too.,3925
Massachusetts,I like how cool you look when you're pushing yourself hard but overdoing it isn't good. I'll force you to rest if I have to.,3925
Massachusetts,If I told you this year's chocolate is store-bought would you believe it? Heehee. It fooled my sisters but I suppose there's no fooling you. How did you figure out I made it myself? Did you spy on me or?,3926
Massachusetts,Hey Is this outfit that strange to you? Thought it looks just like what my sister's wearing so what are you staring at? I don't get you at all,3926
Massachusetts,My plans for the party? We could go listen to Dakota play the piano.,3927
Massachusetts,Tell me what you think when you're done looking. Else I'm not letting you leave.,3927
Massachusetts,Where's Jean Bart gone? I wanted to show her how I look.,3928
Massachusetts,Seems everyone's enjoying the party. Hope Dakota and Alabama are too. Me? I'm having tons of fun.,3928
Massachusetts,I shouldn't lift this flap? Why not?,3929
Massachusetts,Are you getting more weird thoughts because of my outfit?,3929
Massachusetts,Oh rewards have come in. Good stuff.,3930
Massachusetts,Makeup is tricky stuff I don't know how everyone else does it.,3930
Massachusetts,Fighting while trying not to get my dress dirty Kinda fun.,3931
Matchless,You know flattery won't get you anywhere with me right?,3931
Matchless,I hope I can just stay as your secretary forever Hm? What? I didn't say anything!,3932
Matchless,Because of that I'm subtracting a few points off your record~!,3932
Matchless,I-I'm scared I want to stay with you,3933

Matchless,I should've known You can't possibly protect me,3936
Matchless,My name might make me seem invincible but that's not true at all. Don't mistake me for a Main Fleet ship just because of my name!,3936
Matchless,Duke of York is tough cool and Hehe~ She must make you jealous too~,3937
Matchless,The feelings I have for you and the feelings you have for me Which of the two is more passionate?,3937
Matchless,Physical scars heal over time but mental scars never go away. So please don't make my heart ache!,3938
Matchless,Here's your Valentine's chocolate~ This is neither a bribe for you to protect me nor a thank-you gift for your hard work. I simply felt like giving you chocolate and being with you today because I'm confident you will always watch over feeble little me,3938
Matchless,If some questionable individuals suddenly showed up you'd be there to protect me right?,3939
Matchless,Hmm it feels like someone is always staring at me is it just my imagination?,3939
Matchless,Haven't decided on where to go yet? That's totally fine I'm happy to just have you here.,3940
Matsukaze,I wonder how my sisters are doing I'm worried about them,3940
Matsukaze,This thing I've got? It's what's known as a ladle. Yeah if it was a little smaller you could even serve tea with it.,3941
Matsukaze,Ahhh the smell of laundry hung out to dry in the sun~ Isn't it great?,3941
Matsukaze,Yeah? Are you feeling tired? Then wait just a moment I've finished making some snacks!,3942
Matsukaze,You must be tired after that last battle Don't overexert yourself come here and lie down.,3942
Matsukaze,Thanks! You could have saved caring about me for later though.,3943
Matsukaze,Don't do anything too dangerous okay?,3943
Matsukaze,Heheh you'll have a really bad time if you underestimate a veteran!,3944
Matsukaze,Ugh I'll be fine just make a break for it everyone,3944
Matsukaze,Sigh Where did I go wrong with you,3945
Matsukaze,If you don't have anything to do you should tidy things up. Organization is fundamental to leading a good life.,3945
Matsukaze,You just need to focus on your goals and I'll handle all the minor details. I'm happy to help you with anything not just combat or missions~!,3946
Matsukaze,You're saying you want to take a lifelong vow with me? Eheheh sure~ Then I Matsukaze swear to always always look after you!,3946
Matsukaze,Hmm Wow. No unusual expenditures this year. What's gotten into you? Are you being considerate of us? I appreciate the thought but Huh? You're handmaking chocolate to keep expenses down? For everyone?!,3947
Matsukaze,I doubt this fan will be of any use when it gets cold,3947
Matsukaze,I think this thing will be handy for drying clothes or futons out in the sun! Mhm I think I'll test it right now!,3948
Matsukaze,"Umm have you heard about ""work-life balance""? It's bad to rest too much but it's not good to work too much either.",3948
Matsukaze,Hm? Are you hungry? Or do you want me to fan you?,3949
Maury,Umm Why are you always watching me do my warm-ups? Do you like watching me sweat?,3949

Maury,I swear it wasn't my tummy making that noise!,3950
Maury,Are you helping me recover?  Thank you,3951
Maury,!! Hey! There's a line you shouldn't cross when giving massages.,3951
Maury,Phew~ I'm exhausted Save some Oxy-cola for me when the rewards arrive!,3952

Maya,Would you stop staring at me like that? I can't promise my sword won't come your way,3957
Maya,The South Solomon Island Leyte Gulf and now this sea Nothing ever changes,3957
Maya,Being by Yamato is like a warm embrace that melts away my worries I sometimes long for that feeling N-no it’s not Iike that! I may have said that but not in that way! But if I put it that way,3958

Maya, It hurts No don't mind me.,3962
Maya,Perish by my blade!,3963
Maya,Hmph. Retreat? How laughable.,3963
Maya,If you get too close to me I’ll cut you dow,3964
Maya,Didn’t I already tell you? Don’t talk to me if you don’t have any business.,3964
Maya,I said don’t talk to me if- You want to know more about me? Fine as you wish.,3965
Maya,My dream is to one day conquer the sky and everything beneath it. When that day comes would you still remain by my side?,3965
Maya,Looks like I've made you wait. Listen up we'll be meeting up with Choukai before heading to a store that has some real tasty chocolate Hey don't be that dissapointed that I didn't make you some chocolate this year. It doesn't have to be chocolate I made as long as you enjoy it right? With all that said just remember I'll be treating you to the chocolate at the store. Got it?,3966
Maya,Ah Achoo! Sorry. I called you over to make it easy for you but obviously it's doing the opposite Anyway happy Valentine's. I made this chocolate for you in secret – without help from Choukai or my other sisters. Will you accept it?,3966
Maya,When you're alone with no one to turn to things get lonely. But it's different when you're waiting for someone you know will come right? Especially when I'm waiting for you Heheh it's heartwarming for sure. Achoo! S-sorry.,3967
McCall,Sorry can we keep it brief? I need a new popsicle.,3967
McCall,We all get along around here don't you think? Care for a popsicle?,3968
McCall,Ahh Hawaii was so hot. I felt like I was melting,3968
McCall, Ah! Oh no! My popsicle melted.,3969
McCall, Are you trying to encourage me?,3969
McCall,Ah it's so hot,3970
McCall,Missions huh? Whatever happens happens.,3970
McCall,Help me pack up these rewards Hey can we have them sent to my house?,3971
McCall,*Sigh* There's no end to all this mail,3971
McCall,It's kinda hot in here got anything to help me cool down?,3972
McCall,Oh everyone's back. I'll go get some popsicles.,3972
McCall,Hm It's nothing special.,3973
McCall,We have to fight? Guess I couldn't avoid it forever,3973
McCall,"Slay the enemy while your blade is still warm"" Is that true for popsicles as well? Oh it melted",3974
McCall,Whoa I got so scared I dropped my popsicle,3974
McCall,Let's finish this before my popsicle melts!,3975
McCall,I heard those Sakura Empire girls sit around and drink tea all afternoon. I'd like to try that some day!,3975
McCall,Tips for daydreaming? Empty your mind and don't think about anything. Don't forget about your popsicle before it melts though,3976
McCall,Guess that concludes our yearly Valentine's ritual. Hey can't we just eat popsicles together after we've done the whole give-you-chocolate routine? Y'know like we always do. That's more our style I think. Probably. Scratch that definitely.,3976
McCall,"Oh I won again. Every one you buy for me always says ""Try Again."" Here this is your Valentine's Day chocolate popsicle. If you draw another one I'll get to eat another one. And then you can Uhh well I'm glad you're playing along but are you sure your wallet's gonna be fine?",3977
Memphis,If you intend to keep me by your side you'd better carefully observe my every move!,3977
Memphis,Capturing everyone's attention with my brilliant performance at Naval Reviews - that's the way I like to do things.,3978
Memphis,Because of my hectic schedule I never got much time to relax back in port But that's fine someone like me ought to be busy wouldn't you agree~?,3978
Memphis,You want me to bring you back a souvenir next time? Should you really be asking that while you still have work to do?,3979
Memphis,Hm? You'd like to see me while I'm training? Very well you'd better burn this into your eyes!,3979

Memphis,Let's go! I want to see everyone at their best!,3983

Memphis,Are you even going to be able to finish all that chocolate? Well I'm glad you still have room for mine but don't overdo it okay?,3988
Memphis,I suspect you'll be staring down a mountain of Valentine's chocolate this year – again – so I've got something new for you: a dietary plan to eat all that chocolate in a methodical manner. This is what it means to help in private I suppose Of course I do also have chocolate for you if you're interested.,3988
Memphis,Chocolate is an excellent energy food. To have it only today would be a shame so I made you a whole year's worth. Here's your supply for this month. The rest are in a dedicated space in the fridge where they won't spoil as long as Hello? Are you listening?,3989
Memphis,Oh my do I really look so unusual in this outfit? I want to be able to enjoy my day off as well you know? Hehe don't you think it feels nice to just sit back and take in the ocean breeze?,3989
Memphis,Morning. There's a nice wind blowing today. Perfect for a cruise wouldn't you say?,3990
Memphis,My pictures? I wouldn't say I put the pros to shame but I am experienced. Don't go underestimating my ability.,3990
Memphis,Brooklyn and I sometimes go out on day trips. Unlike me though she just refuses to relax even on vacation days Or rather we each relax in very different ways I suppose.,3991

Memphis,Eek! Wh-what was that for?!,3992
Memphis,I'm a witch now so if you're not on your best behavior I'll turn you into a critter~ Hehe just kidding!,3992
Memphis,Look a witch and her broomstick are always paired together. I won't hear your objections!,3993
Memphis, I should just boot you off the broomstick and be done with it!,3993
Memphis,Everyone has a different way of enjoying Halloween. Hehe that's how it should be~,3994
Memphis,Have a taste of a witch's power!,3994
Memphis,Fashionably late I see. Had you turned up a moment later I would've gone home for the day.,3995
Memphis,This? Just a doodle nothing of note Please would you stop trying to peek?,3995
Memphis,Omaha! Don't you think the amount of snacks in your desk drawers is a little excessive?,3996
Memphis,Let's see what's new on Juustagram Concord's posted a new sweets review. That's worth a read.,3996
Memphis,I love sitting by the window. You get a great view of the schoolyard and have ready access to a cool breeze.,3997

Mikasa,The victory at Tsushima did not occur by chance.,4006
Mikasa,"Those things flying through the sky Err they're called ""ear-playings"" right?",4006
Mikasa,Even the most hardworking people sometimes have lapses of judgment. It is my duty to admonish you in times like these.,4007
Mikasa,Hmm I'm in charge of today's fleet operations? Very well the fate of our country rests mmf!  Why aren't you letting me speak?,4007
Mikasa,Very well. I shall plunder I mean receive the spoils of victory!,4008
Mikasa,No matter how many medals and honors I receive Ehehe~,4008
Mikasa,Excellent! The scales of war are tipping in our favor!,4009
Mikasa,Without robust logistics even the mightiest fleets will turn into a disorderly mob.,4009
Mikasa,Only the battlefield can separate the wheat from the chaff.,4010
Mikasa,The fate of our country rests upon this battle!,4010
Mikasa,Through righteousness comes prosperity. Such is the will of the heavens.,4011
Mikasa,So this what it must have felt like to suffer through the Battle of Dan-no-ura,4011
Mikasa,Let every ship do her utmost!,4012
Mikasa,Keep calm! This battle is far from over!,4012
Mikasa,You Showa-born brat!,4013
Mikasa,Thinking about how I won't see old friends from back in my day ever again it's Well never mind. I have people who look up to me now and I can't let them down!,4013
Mikasa,If you don't have a plan to end a war then you'd better not start one to begin with!,4014
Mikasa,Yes I can tell you've been working hard. B- but! That doesn't mean you get to start goldbricking now!,4014
Mikasa,You can't fire on all four boilers all the time. Listen I'm going to look the other way while you take five You've been wanting to nap on my lap? I-I guess that'd be okay,4015
Mikasa,You still got a long way to go to earn my respect!  Hehehe so that's why I better stick by you 'Til you're too good even for me.,4015
Mikasa,It looks like it's Valentine's Day once again. Hm yes! This year in addition to my chocolate I'll give you the right to be spoiled by me to your heart's content! Since you're always working so diligently you need to make sure to relax every once in a while. Otherwise your body won't last you know!,4016
Mikasa,What a well-behaved youngster you are! How about resting in my lap? So what do you want to do next? Hahaha there's no need to be shy. As promised I'll treat you to as much as you want on Valentine's Day!,4016
Mikasa,That slovenly look on your face I did say that I'll spoil you on Valentine's Day but seeing you like this I can't help but worry how you are doing day-to-day. Listen: I want to keep healthy boundaries but if you're always tired then you may visit me once in a while.,4017
Mikasa,I battleship Mikasa from now until eternity pledge to you my undying love and devotion. May we help each other encourage each other and walk side-by-side on the same path. I hope to meet your expectations as unworthy as I may be.,4017
Mikasa,"I can't get used to calling you ""Dear"" or you calling me ""Honey"" Calling each other by what we already do would be easier? Very well as long as you're fine with it",4018
Mikasa,Well perfect timing. Hm It looks like this size should fit you As the one in charge you can't neglect stocking up on necessities. Once we're in the middle of battle even your best clothes can get all torn up in the blink of an eye. Make sure you to get some spares while we're still in the lull of peace.,4018
Mikasa,Tonight's menu How about I make you naval curry that originates from a port I have an affinity with? Of course it's simply exquisite.,4019
Mikasa,"So those are ""airplanes."" The true potential of new things are often overlooked for quite some time. Do your best to not do the same.",4019
Mikasa,Urgh how in the world do you use this cellular phone thing? Grrrr,4020
Mikasa,You're working very hard so I guess I'll allow this much,4020
Mikasa,Oi! Don't doze off on me! I promise I'll let you rest after you read through the mission!,4021
Mikasa,Very good. Well done! We're done with the mission! You really should teach Zuikaku and the others how you do it.,4021
Mikasa,Hehe These medals and awards are things I obtained with you by my side. Go ahead burn the sight into your mind~,4022
Mikasa,You brought everyone back safely without a hitch! Spectacularly done I must say. Hahaha!,4022
Mikasa,Vanquish all evil! Crush the enemy!,4023
Mikasa,As long as you put your mind to it there's no war you can't win! Redouble your efforts and keep up the good work!,4023
Mikasa,Mhm a fine morning. Have you had breakfast yet?,4024
Mikasa,Mm what a pleasant breeze. A fine day to embark on a new journey.,4024
Mikasa,When I don this uniform I feel like I'm being called to my more youthful days Ah that's right! It's that excitement of going on a trip for the first time as a kid! Hehe~,4025
Mikasa,Back then many of us went abroad to study with the Royal Navy. Hm you can't picture me doing that? Want to see for yourself? Well we're just a few minutes from the Royal dorms though. Hahaha!,4025
Mikasa,Looking back I sometimes miss those days but right now this fleet is where I belong.,4026
Mikasa,Hey! Knock that off! You're going to make me drop my luggage,4026
Mikasa,Everyone has returned home safely. What a relief.,4027
Mikasa,I was thinking what if I was still a schoolgirl meeting you for the first time beneath the dancing cherry blossoms before becoming inseparable sweethearts A scenario like that might have been nice.,4027
Mikasa,Mhm clear skies and a gentle breeze. Fine weather indeed for admiring the flowers.,4028
Mikasa,F-fine I shall permit it just a little.,4028
Mikasa,The flowering season waits for nobody. Feast your eyes upon this magnificence before the petals wither. Ahaha!,4029
Mikasa,Even I like to dress down and unwind from time to time. Oh? This is new and exciting for you? Well you are welcome to come see more of it from now on! Hahaha!,4029
Mikasa,Though it is said that spring is the season of restful slumber sleeping in simply because you feel like it is no good at all.,4030
Mikasa,What should I do on this well-earned vacation? Assembling model ships? Housework? Travel? Too many things to do,4030
Mikasa,Nagato do not excessively concern yourself with the opinions of others. Simply set your worries aside and enjoy yourself.,4031
Mikasa,What's the matter? You want to give my clothes a rub? Haha so you can tell the difference! Very good very good!,4031
Mikasa,Hey hey you're going to expose me at this rate.,4032
Mikasa,Have you finished your work? Excellent then feel free to spend the rest of your day as you please!,4032
Mikasa,People will get bored sooner or later if our menu is nothing but Sakura-style confections Should we add some curry or Western snacks?,4033
Mikasa,Mutsu please! We all know you've got a sweet tooth but the café's food is off-limits! We've got staff meals right over there.,4033
Mikasa,Maybe I ought to take your order myself. Hahaha!,4034
Mikasa,Say what kind of establishment do you think this is?,4034
Mikasa,"Excellent; you've returned in one piece! Ah I suppose girls these days say ""Welcome home Master!"" Hmm Maybe that sounds a bit too forced",4035
Mikasa,Our commission team has returned. Get excited for some new menu items!,4035
Mikasa,Hahaha! Seems like we'll have to jazz up that celebratory menu eh?,4036
Mikasa,"It's a little different from the other girls but that just makes it suit me more"" huh? Is it just me or are you getting smoother by the day? Hah!",4036
Mikasa,"Huh so this is the ""Beauty Looking Back"" It's really embarrassing to hear you say that about me though.",4037
Mikasa,"They weren't kidding when they said ""no road is long with good company."" I just hope you're having a good time too Hahaha that's what I like to hear!",4037
Mikasa,Hmm. So there are famous mountains historical sites and even temples and shrines I dunno if we'll be able to see all of this now. I say this calls for a repeat trip!,4038
Mikasa,Hm? You wanna hear the story behind this dress? Then get comfy and prepare for a lecture from your guide Mikasa!,4038
Mikasa,Hey! No touching the sash! Phew. That scared me y'know.,4039
Mikasa,You plan the missions and I'll plan the trip! Uh how do you use this tablet exactly?,4039
Mikasa,Finished your mission? Good timing! I just finished checking out this tourist spot.,4040
Mikasa,Let's stop and take in the peace you've brought us. Getting proper rest between fierce battles is part of your job! Heheh.,4040
Mikasa,Oh the commission team's back? Don't forget to get them some souvenirs while we're here.,4041
Mikasa,Battleship Mikasa is here! Let's do this!,4041
Mikazuki,I like taiyaki filled with bean paste even in their tail fins.,4042
Mikazuki,Taiyaki looks like a fish Fish live in the sea! Hm the sea is on Earth! Earth is in space! Mm so tasty!,4042
Mikazuki,Oh I dropped my taiyaki,4043
Mikazuki,I ate too much taiyaki I'm stuffed,4043
Mikazuki,That's the enemy can we eat them?,4044
Mikazuki,Isn't it about time for a snack?,4044
Mikazuki,I'm hungry,4045
Mikazuki,You're not getting any of my taiyaki!,4045
Mikazuki,Ahh~ *Nom* (Mikazuki doesn't seem to notice you.),4046
Mikazuki,Clothes are so annoying I hate getting dressed I just want to eat taiyaki,4046
Mikazuki,Getting changed is a pain but since everyone wanted to see me in a costume I did it Hip hop.,4047
Mikazuki,Halloween is all about witches pumpkins and delicious taiyaki! Ommfh!,4047
Mikazuki,If the seal on my head gets removed I'll turn into a real zombie That's what Minazuki said anyway.,4048
Mikazuki,My outfit is all messed up now even though it took so long to put on,4048
Mikazuki,I got so much candy Mutsuki seems to really like them so I'll give it all to her later.,4049
Mikuma,Welcome back. Let's try to get a lot of work done today.,4049

Mikuma,Loading complete! Main guns fire!,4053
Mikuma,Don't panic! We still have a chance!,4054
Mikuma,I've gotta warn my sister about how untrustworthy you are,4054
Mikuma,All Mogami-class cruisers were part of Cruiser Division 7 but because Kumano and Suzuya were launched later than me it was I who had to look after Mogami. And for that reason they aren't as close to her as I am.,4055
Mikuma,Mogami asked me to help her make chocolate this year! We put our heads together for a while and it resulted in this incredible-tasting chocolate! Heheh is it right for Valentine's to be such a happy day?,4055
Mikuma,I want to see my sister dance but I'm better suited for an event like this.,4056
Mikuma,Kumano also wants to try dancing? That could be arranged Wait no! What if she tears her costume because her movements are too flashy?,4056
Mikuma,Mikuma stands at attention. Please give your orders.,4057
Mikuma,Umm please mind my main battery It might explode!,4057
Mikuma,My horn is cute?,4058
Mikuma,I've finished collecting the mission rewards. I think it's about to go check on my sister,4058
Mikuma,Mission complete. I'm sure my sister is also pleased by this. Heehee.,4059
Mikuma,The commission team has returned. Want to take Suzuya and Kumano with you when you head over?,4059

Minneapolis,It’s kinda boring talking to you,4073
Minneapolis,Compared to staying at port it’s way more fun to go on a hunt! How about we plan one right away?,4073
Minneapolis,There’s actually a few places in port that I am interested in investigating. Let’s go and explore them now! Work? We can still make it on time even if we wait a bit longer!,4074
Minneapolis,When did you get this injury? Could it be that time when you were with me hey don’t move let me help you by licking it.,4074
Minneapolis,Valentine's? Chocolate? Not exactly my kinda stuff Then how about this: I'll give you this herb then you can return the favor with some chocolate another day. Sound good? Great then we both get something outta this!,4075
Minneapolis,Hah! So what do you think of my mouthwatering baked chocolate? Sure it won't win any beauty pageants but the taste is top-notch! If it wasn't you wouldn't be drawn to it like prey to a trap! Hahaha!,4075
Minneapolis,You serious?! Now that we're married we're gonna be cleaning the office together?!,4076

Minneapolis,Did a Meowfficer on a skateboard just swoosh past me? Must've imagined it,4083
Minneapolis,Check out my boardslide! Haha!,4084
Minneapolis,Nothing beats this feeling of being able to move freely and not bound by anything!,4084
Minneapolis,Try and keep up if you can! Hahaha!,4085
Minneapolis,Whuah! Th-the hell're you doing?!,4085
Minneapolis,I taught myself how to ride a skateboard. It was a piece of cake. Fitness comes with being a hunter like me.,4086
Minneapolis,It's time to roll!,4086
Minneapolis,The engine's rumbling music to my ears. Seems like today's gonna be a great day!,4087
Minneapolis,Was the present bag open? Oh thanks for letting me know! Hm looks like it's a bit dented on the side?,4087
Minneapolis,This guy over here has some nice horsepower but riding and controlling it is a bit rough. I'm grateful to Jamaica for all her help.,4088
Minneapolis,What is it? The cold? This much is nothing to me.,4088
Minneapolis,Wha?! S-Stop! The steering wheel!,4089
Minneapolis,Are you done with your mission? Great let's head out to deliver some presents!,4089
Minsk,Gangut? Err I mean Comrade Gangut? Hmm she kind of scares me,4090

Minsk,Eh?! Is this revenge for something I did?!,4091
Minsk,Long live the rewards! Err so where's my share?,4092
Minsk,Ah um Just give me a minute to come up with an explanation as to what I'm doing in this room full of mail,4092

Minsk,It's my turn! Fiiire!,4096
Minsk,Looks like it's time for me to get serious!,4096
Minsk,All right I finally understand now! I've finally reached a conclusion as to why I'm always thinking about you! So here's my hypothesis: I'm in love with you! Hehe does that sound right?,4097
Minsk,You've violated the Minsk Protocol comrade! Therefore the sentence appropriate for you is imprisonment! Until when? Obviously until your jailor is satisfied~,4097
Minsk,Entrust your faith with god and entrust your body with me! That's right you're in my jail now!,4098
Minsk,Fools dance for your overlord~,4098
Minsk,If you try to escape again I'll slap more time onto your sentence? Huh? You weren't given a sentence in the first place? Eh don't sweat the details~,4099
Minsk,When I'm not patrolling I'm writing reports this jailor business is super boring! Hey one of you prisoners write the reports for me!,4099

Miyuki,Oh these bandages? They're just in case I bump into a tree branch again B-but you don't need to worry about it! I'm already used to it,4101
Miyuki,Fubuki is as outgoing as ever If only I could be brimming with positivity just like her F-forget I said anything,4102
Miyuki,My tail is warm and fluffy? Um p-please don't go touching it all of a sudden I'm a bit sensitive there,4102
Miyuki,Um is the fog rolling in? Bad weather makes me feel really uneasy I really hate bad weather,4103
Miyuki,Naka and her sisters are the ones who make my tail look pretty and nice I can't do it all by myself,4103
Miyuki,P-please don't do that at least not where others can see,4104
Miyuki,I I will be okay,4104
Miyuki,Th-thank you very much! I I'll work twice as hard!,4105
Miyuki,What nice weather That means the battle should go smoothly right,4105
Miyuki,I hope I managed to do something useful,4106
Miyuki,You don't need a useless girl like me right I'm so sorry,4106
Miyuki,I don't want to have to say goodbye ever again!,4107
Miyuki,*sniffle* I hate it when this happens!,4107
Miyuki,Thank you for accepting me here! I will do my best to repay this act of kindness! B-but first I need to not cause trouble for you,4108
Miyuki,I'm sunnier and more positive than before? Fubuki told me the same thing Ehehe,4108
Miyuki,I I don't mind if you like touching my tail I can do anything for your sake *blushes*,4109
Miyuki,The weather looks pretty bad outside But I'll be fine! Because you promised to always stay by my side and to save me even if I get hurt,4109
Miyuki,Is it okay if Umm we hold hands a bit longer?,4110
Miyuki,I um I don't mind *blushes*,4110
Miyuki,It it doesn't hurt at all I feel warm and fuzzy inside when you pat my head,4111
Miyuki,I did it Finally Ehehe!,4111
Miyuki,My most heartfelt wish? Well just getting to spend every day with you is already enough to make me happy Um but if I have to make a wish I'd like to always stay here a place I can call home with the person I love,4112
Miyuki,Do I like going shopping by myself? N-not really The way people look at me is a bit scary so I usually go with Fubuki or Shirayuki,4112
Miyuki,It's important to stock up on food you know? Just in case we can't go shopping because of bad weather like a typhoon or something,4113
Miyuki,Eep! What's wrong? Oh I'm going to hurt myself if I keep rubbing the pointy part? Oh th-thank you,4113
Miyuki,Ehehe,4114
Miyuki,There's a new mission Go ahead and take a look at it. You don't need to worry about me,4114
Miyuki,The mission rewards are in D-do you think we could go fetch them together? *blushes*,4115
Miyuki,Our friends who were out on a commission are back. But it'll be a while until they'll stop by to restock right?,4115
Mogami,Welcome back. Huh? You want me to say it with more emotion? Sorry chief. Not sure I can help with that one.,4116
Mogami,Not saying anything makes you look cool? Figures you would believe something like that.,4116
Mogami,I wonder what Mikuma is doing right now Well I suppose there's nothing to worry about. She's not like me after all,4117
Mogami,Are you sure you want me to be your secretary? Just about anybody else would be better for the job. I'm serious I'm not just saying that to avoid work.,4117
Mogami,Perhaps I should get Nachi to teach me how to be a little more cheerful crap hope nobody heard that,4118
Mogami,You don't have to remind me I'll get the work done.,4118
Mogami,I finished organizing the task list. Even I couldn't mess something like this up probably.,4119
Mogami,I picked up the mail. Can I leave it here?,4119
Mogami,Everyone made it back safely. Isn't that enough?,4120
Mogami,You're going to go greet the commission fleet? I'll just stay here so I don't end up ramming into someone.,4120
Mogami,Thanks What's the matter? Am I not allowed to express gratitude?,4121
Mogami,Fighting is a drag but losing is an even bigger drag!,4121
Mogami,First place huh. Got a problem with it?,4122
Mogami,So this is what I'm made of,4122
Mogami,I won't fail this time!,4123
Mogami,Have I spread my misfortune to everyone?,4123
Mogami,You must really have some strange hobbies to want to associate with hapless folks like me. Oh well if it's just talking I suppose I can entertain you,4124
Mogami,My horn huh Well I don't really mind but it kind of sticks out doesn't it? I don't really like the attention *sigh*,4124
Mogami,I already know that Mikuma and Nachi don't hold anything against me but I can't forgive myself *sigh* Huh? My horn is cute?! I-idiot,4125
Mogami,Are you sure you won't regret choosing someone like me? If you say so I suppose I can put in a bit more effort for our sake A-anyway please take care of me,4125
Mogami,I only started making chocolate because you suggested it but when I really thought of how I could make great chocolate to make you happy I realized that it's a pretty deep field It makes me embarrassed at how short-sighted I used to be.,4126
Mogami,Are you sure this is a retrofit and not some weird hazing ritual? I look Well I suppose I do feel stronger. Guess I'll try to work a bit harder. Wouldn't hurt for you to look forward to it a little.,4126
Mogami,I look even cooler now when I don't say anything? Whatever have it your way,4127
Mogami,Recently Mikuma has been telling me that I have more self-esteem Not sure about that one though I don't think I've really changed,4127
Mogami,Secretary ship duties? Well I still think I'm not really cut out for it compared to the others but if it's what you want I'll keep doing it.,4128
Mogami,Maybe I should go practice using this naginata or something,4128
Mogami,There are people waiting for me so I refuse to lose!,4129
Monarch,You are the one and only being who matters to me Until I met you there was nary a single soul who believed in me.,4129
Monarch,Wales and York I despise them for bereaving me of my existence but I cannot resent them for succeeding me.,4130
Monarch,A younger sister? If I have one her name would be Prince of Wales That has a rather nice ring to it.,4130
Monarch,I will make the world understand how foolish it was not to choose me.,4131
Monarch,Do not fall victim to those degenerate habits of theirs.,4131
Monarch,Let me handle this mission. I shall prove my excellence!,4132
Monarch,For as long as I exist it isn't over. I am excellence itself therefore I must exist.,4132
Monarch,You've received mail regarding the war. You would do best to check it.,4133
Monarch,That was a marvellous welcome. Hmph were I the only one returning would anyone welcome me at all?,4133
Monarch,I wonder what efforts it took to materialise me Hmph regardless I will see to it they are repaid in double.,4134
Monarch,Hmph sure enough I am the most excellent of the King George V class.,4134
Monarch,Depend on me! I will make sure this fleet returns home without as much as a scratch!,4135
Monarch,Heed my words: depend on me! I will always win!,4135
Monarch,Am I being discarded yet again?,4136
Monarch,Not even the Queen's orders can subdue me!,4136
Monarch,If Wales were me she would probably have sunk long ago.,4137
Monarch,Are you saying that I am inferior to them?!,4137
Monarch,I only survived in that dark world by believing that I am excellence itself and thus irreplaceable,4138
Monarch,Love needs no repayment. No matter how much the Royal Family neglects me my loyalty to them is unwavering.,4138
Monarch,So they can still laugh together Perhaps I wasn't discarded for nought then I have never felt this way before.,4139
Monarch,Even if the world no longer needs me you will always need me. That is more than enough for me Hahah perhaps I was materialised with the sole purpose of meeting you. Even if so I am happy.,4139
Monarch,Right Valentine's chocolate to make us set aside our differences. Then again I wouldn't be doing this in the first place if Howe hadn't pushed her cookies on me Never mind that. Here I made this chocolate syrup myself. It's not Valentine's if I don't enjoy a chocolatey treat with you.,4140
Monarch,Shall I teach you the Royal Navy's courtly dances?,4140
Monarch,Such splendid dress is normally reserved for special occasions. But for me every day I exist is a day to be celebrated.,4141
Monarch,You like this dress do you? Hmph I see you've learned the art of empty flattery from Wales. But nonetheless thank you,4141
Monarch,I admire your bravery. Now would you rather I stab or trample you? Or would you prefer to taste a volley from my guns?,4142
Monarch,Allow me to demonstrate the elegance with which a lady of the Royal Navy comports herself.,4142
Monarch,So an Eastern outfit this time Hmph. My nobility is evident regardless of what I wear. However since you prepared this outfit especially for me it would be unbecoming of me to not express my gratitude. Thank you.,4143
Monarch,This festival comes but once a year. I shan't let you waste it working yourself to death. Come let me handle that. The fleet will survive you taking a break.,4143
Monarch,"Paint our jubilant memories of this festival into history""? Hmph she's as grandiloquent as ever isn't she?",4144
Monarch,Tsk Wales must you always pester me with this Dragon Empery chinoiserie? I'll learn about their customs myself without you.,4144
Monarch,A New Year's wish? Naturally I wish to prove you were right to choose me. That isn't going to change.,4145
Monarch,Though I am a proud lady of the Royal Navy I find myself deeply moved to have this chance to experience a festival from an exotic culture.,4145
Monarch,You desire my company? You should have said so.,4146
Montpelier,So you're back. I'll take my leave then. It's too crowded in here for me.,4146
Montpelier,Big sis!  Oh it's you. Need something?,4147
Montpelier,"How can I be more like Cleveland ""Smile""?  That might not be possible",4147
Montpelier, Huh? If you've no need of me don't call for me.,4148
Montpelier,G-gotta put up with it This is obviously a test of the trust I have for my big sis!,4148
Montpelier,Rewards eh Guess this is part of my job. I'll go get them.,4149
Montpelier,I left your mail over here.,4149
Montpelier,Well done. You should get some rest.,4150
Montpelier,A commission's done. Aren't you gonna welcome the team back?,4150
Montpelier,I'm one step closer to my big sis!,4151
Montpelier,Knights of the Sea onwards!,4151
Montpelier,This is how victory feels Not bad.,4152
Montpelier,Big sis I'm sorry I've stained the reputation of the Knights of the Sea,4152
Montpelier,You're an eyesore. Disappear!,4153
Montpelier,Big sis told me to never give up!,4153
Montpelier,Guess my big sis can't tell good and bad people apart,4154
Montpelier,I don't get why my big sis chose you. But I trust her intuition.,4154
Montpelier,My big sis is strong cool has a golden smile and she could probably beat anyone in a fight I want to be like her one day.,4155
Montpelier,I don't just blindly listen to everything my big sis says. I listen because she's always right And I finally get why she chose you. It's because you're outstanding.,4155
Montpelier,I made some chocolate for my big sis and for you. Yeah I made it by myself so don't be too hard on it I'm giving you it first so I know what to expect when I give the other to Cleve. Eat it quick and tell me if it's any good.,4156
Montpelier,"You're a special case so I can tolerate you going on a date with Cleve under one condition. First you have to take ME on a date. Got it? ""Gladly""?! You're not supposed to say that!",4156
Montpelier,The Sakura Empire's New Year's celebration is a bit different from my expectations.,4157
Montpelier,The sleeves on this outfit are long and heavy and this uh dress? It's really hard to move around in. Don't they find this cumbersome?,4157
Montpelier,If Cleve was to wear this outfit Hmm I can't picture it after all.,4158
Montpelier,My New Year's wish? I'd like to get a bit closer with Cleve I suppose,4158
Montpelier,Everyone is hard at work preparing for New Year's but what in the world is going on inside that head of yours?,4159
Montpelier,Spending the end of the year with you isn't so bad You really still want to see me dance in this outfit? Hmm I'm probably a bit rusty but let's just consider it a rehearsal for when I'm doing this for Cleve.,4159
Montpelier,"As unreliable as you are I didn't think you'd be too scared to approach a movie prop You're just ""admiring it from a distance?"" Fair enough.",4160
Montpelier,"Welcome back darling."" This feels wrong. Doesn't fit the scene.",4160
Montpelier,This set really is expertly made. It shocked me when I first laid eyes on it.,4161
Montpelier,I'm only wearing this dress because big sis told me to. It's the total opposite of the clothes I'm used to wearing Hm? That's not the point of this all?,4161
Montpelier,Change my pose? Okay. How's this? I have no clue what you think is so funny about this. Guess it doesn't matter as long as big sis is enjoying herself,4162
Montpelier,Wanna sit next to me? This thing is built to handle several people.,4162
Montpelier,No thanks. I can get down on my own. The set isn't a hard climb or anything I'm just not used to wearing this dress.,4163
Montpelier,Are you that keen to taste the power of darkness?,4163
Montpelier,Time to go back to the party? All right. Give me a moment to come down.,4164
Montpelier,"Kneel to the power of darkness!"" Is it cooler to recite this line from the script?",4164
Morrison,I'd really like to get my hands on a few sets of the Iron Blood's rigging Heh hehehe,4165
Morrison,Y-yes you called? You didn't? I'm sorry,4165
Morrison,It's sunny out today Though it's not like sunny days are always good either.,4166
Morrison,M-Mr. Bear is on a rampage?!,4166
Morrison,You completed the missions? That means that I'm free for the time being right?,4167
Morrison,A commission has been completed. Umm if you need any help I don't mind,4167
Morrison,I really don't think you need to go that far for someone like me,4168
Morrison,N-not another battle,4168
Morrison,Whew That should give me a bit of leeway,4169
Morrison,Oww Ugh I want to go back to port,4169
Morrison,Does anyone need any help?,4170
Morrison,Mr. Bear save me!,4170
Morrison,Just like I thought things are better without me around,4171
Morrison,D-Did you call for me? Yes! Leave whatever it is to me!,4171
Morrison,It's sunny today. Sunny days are nice aren't they? Yes!,4172
Morrison,Um if there's anything I can help with J-just let me know okay?,4172
Morrison,Ah um I'm so sorry Mr. Bear is very sensitive to sudden movements and he'll spring up to defend me,4173
Morrison,All done with the missions? Let's take a little break then,4173
Morrison,Mr. Bear charge!,4174
Morrison,I should use this chance to perform some maintenance on Mr. Bear Alright done!,4174
Morrison,It's a bit embarrassing but it's surprisingly comfortable,4175
Morrison,Benson told me all about the ins and outs of Planet Bunny Huh? Is something amiss?,4175
Morrison,"I wonder if I should take Stanly's advice and turn Mr. Bear into ""Rabbit Mode""",4176
Morrison,I'm so jealous of all the people that get to wear cute clothes Y-you think I'm cute too?,4176
Morrison,I-it's spicy? Was it Thatcher? No it could have been Kalk,4177
Morrison,C-can I take a nap yet?,4177
Morrison,M-my ears are going to fall off,4178
Mullany,Aww I thought I followed the recipe perfectly so how did it turn out like this?,4178
Mullany,Uhh the black smoke coming from that side of the kitchen? Ahaha ha I have no idea what you're talking about~,4179
Mullany,Being treated like a kid feels a bit weird ahaha,4179
Mullany,Ah! An inspiration for my new recipe!,4180
Mullany,I'm number one? Um as long as I can be of help to you I'll be happy,4180
Mullany,I'm ready to go!,4181
Mullany,Cooking for someone you don't like is suffering,4181
Mullany,My cooking would be perfect if I stopped trying to study weird things? Well that's a darn shame! If you ask me the element of surprise is the most important spice!,4182
Mullany,You feel bad for always imposing on me? It's fine it's fine! I'm happiest when I can be of use to the one I care about~ so feel free to rely on me even more from now on!,4182
Mullany,I tried lots of new and different ingredients but since this is such an important day I went with just regular chocolate in the end Please don't be disappointed okay? Huh? If anything you're relieved that I went with regular chocolate?,4183
Mullany,Everyone says love is the ingredient that makes chocolate good but I can't taste it no matter how much I try Maybe only you can taste the difference. I guess in that case Have a bite and tell me what you think.,4183
Mullany,Would you like to have some soup dumplings?,4184
Mullany,After studying abroad in the Dragon Empery and being exposed to their history and culture I've learned to be a bit calmer. However I'm still the same person as before as you can probably tell from my cooking,4184
Mullany,The elegance of ladies from the Empery walking with their parasols opened is a sight to behold. So I picked up a few things from them - want to see?,4185
Mullany,The things I learned in the Dragon Empery came in handy.,4185
Mullany,Cooking for someone else is a whole different experience. Cooking for you? Hm I'd say that's a bit of a heart-racing sensation hehe~,4186
Murmansk,Good morning. Sorry that I'm late I ran into a friend along the way and stopped to have a chat.,4186
Murmansk,How do you like my tails? They're super fluffy and feel nice in your hands~ By the way I made them myself,4187
Murmansk,Are we going on a rescue mission today? I really love helping people~,4187
Murmansk,Pirouette and a spin~ To my right is a fox and a bunny to the left~,4188
Murmansk,Whew Hmm~ Staaare Aha!,4188
Murmansk,Hmmhm~ Oh do you want to chat? Why sure thing!,4189
Murmansk,Ummm I've got just a teensy qualm about you touching me this way,4189
Murmansk,You've still got missions~ Would you like me to pester you about them the next time you forget?,4190

Murmansk,Hmmhm~ Once I start chatting with you it's really hard to stop~ Is that a problem for you in regards to work? Aww that's a shame,4196
Murmansk,Today is my watch-only day but tomorrow we can chat to our heart's content. This should fix our little time-schedule problem~ It doesn't make much difference in the end? Oh I see,4197
Murmansk,Taking this oath means we will share an eternal bond right~? Wonderful! Then from this day forward I promise I will see you every day without it causing you any trouble~,4197

Murmansk,Apparently Pamiat Merkuria likes lazing around too~ I find that surprising but also kind of unsurprising at the same time,4202
Murmansk,Whew I can't help but admire how well everyone's holding up in this snowy weather~,4202
Murmansk,You won't find any tails down there today~,4203
Murmansk,Welcome back~! A warm beverage would be perfect right now~ Like vodka perhaps?,4203
Murmansk,Easy as porridge in the morning~,4204
Murmansk,Oh gosh! Silly me I need to focus!,4204
Musashi,Sometimes it is more important to calm your mind and think about who your allies are than it is to exact vengeance on your enemies.,4205
Musashi,If you are weary you should not hesitate to rest. I shall protect you and take care of your duties in your absence.,4205
Musashi,In my spare time I enjoy foot baths. Soaking my feet in hot water seems to clear my head despite the fact that the two cannot be farther apart. How curious,4206
Musashi,I sometimes see Shinano sound asleep here. May the pleasant dreams you give her last forever.,4206
Musashi,Should you ever feel anxious or frightened please come to me. Your safe haven is here.,4207
Musashi,How precious If the warmth of one's touch is what you crave then leap into my bosom. There is nothing to be ashamed of.,4207
Musashi,A most courageous child Hehe I do not object,4208
Musashi,A new mission? Take it one step at a time and at a comfortable pace. Haste makes waste.,4208
Musashi,The mission rewards have arrived. Our stockpiles continue to grow more and more abundant.,4209
Musashi,I brought over this letter addressed to you. Please look it over.,4209
Musashi,It is good that you have returned safely. Take your time and rest first. To be human is to trudge forward while carrying karmic burden atop your shoulders. There is no need for haste for plenty of trials still await you in the future.,4210
Musashi,The children of the commission fleet have returned. I am unable to personally escort them back but am nevertheless glad to see them safe and sound.,4210
Musashi,"Even the greatest trees start as small saplings."" The smallest bit of effort today may one day become the weapon that shatters the enemy the bulwark that protects what we love.",4211

Musashi,Do not overextend and do not panic. I shall see to it that you are protected.,4212
Musashi,Your time is up!,4213
Musashi,No matter how dire things may be I will always protect you!,4213
Musashi,If you insist on continuing down this path I will not stop you. However never forget that water can either support a ship or capsize it.,4214
Musashi,The more magnificent the tree the more it incurs the wind's jealousy. Remember this well - the more you rise in renown and rank the more you should watch your words and deeds.,4214
Musashi,You've never seen me get mad? Hehe Even the most docile of creatures know when to bare their fangs. You would do well not to judge one by their appearance. Having that said it does take some extraordinary skill to make me angry.,4215
Musashi,Every person has a sentimental side - the same is true for you as it is for me Do you wish to see that side of me? Hehe That all depends on how hard you work for it.,4215
Musashi,What's wrong? Are you still unable to find rest even within my bosom? Your anxiety and frustration are not easily set aside you say? Hehe cast your fears and doubts away and be at peace. As long as you are in Musashi's embrace you shall be protected from all harm.,4216
Musashi,"This would be the ""Valentine's chocolate"" you desire no? Ah the thought of you frantically thinking of how to return the favor a month from now Don't you worry. I'll arrange everything for you.",4216
Musashi,You find some of my colleagues difficult to deal with? Just bring me along next time. I shall teach them that an insult to you is an insult to me as well Oh that's not what you meant?,4217
Musashi,Phew What a long day. Would you like to soak in the foot bath with me? I believe you've earned yourself a break.,4217
Musashi,My favorite food? It'd have to be sea bream. Especially freshly-fried sea bream tempura. Truly a wonderful taste not to be missed.,4218
Musashi,If you ever tire of petty formalities allow me to handle the socializing for you. As always I will make sure everything is done to perfection.,4218
Musashi,My lap awaits you. Hurry and come enjoy your respite.,4219
Musashi,If this sensation is to your liking you are welcome to dive in face-first. Hehe.,4219
Musashi,You're back already? Did I not ask you to inform me beforehand so I can escort you personally?,4220
Musashi,The children of the commission fleet have returned. If you are going to greet them do bring me with you.,4220
Musashi,Relax and bask in the afterglow of victory. Hehe.,4221
Musashi,Fighting until the bitter end serves no purpose. Withdraw for now and come back after regrouping your forces.,4221
Musashi,"Return to my embrace after finishing today's work. What do I mean by ""return"" you ask? Exactly how it sounds. I wish to pamper I mean protect you from those who would take advantage of you in your sleep.",4222
Musashi,"Welcome back Master."" Rather that's what all the children at the café were saying to you when they greeted you at the door. Hehe is this some new custom?",4222
Musashi,Would you like a savory appetizer or perhaps something sweet? Hehe open your mouth. Allow me to feed you.,4223
Musashi,Would you also like to help out with our pop-up café? Though I don't mind if you just stay put over there. I can't help but worry when I am unable to see you,4223
Musashi,To celebrate this great victory I shall see to it that our friends are served the finest refreshments. Hehe naturally it'll all be free of cost.,4224
Musashi,The item you ordered was never delivered? Worry not I think I understand the situation Sakawa I'd like to have a word with you.,4224
Musashi,The girls have been giving it their all to make our pop-up café a success and a few accidents are nothing we cannot overlook. If anyone feels aggrieved on this basis alone then it is only fitting to teach them a lesson.,4225
Musashi,Is someone's service unsatisfactory? I shall go remind her then That's not it? You just need me to handle an extra order?,4225
Musashi,Comfort and solace await you in my bosom. No one shall be allowed to disturb you.,4226
Musashi,Since you're here put your troubles aside for now. We can worry about your mission later.,4226
Musashi,Good job on your sortie. Go ahead and take a seat anywhere you want. After I take care of the rest of my chores I shall come serve you personally. Hehe.,4227
Musashi,Let us expurgate those who would muddy this tidy place!,4227

Mutsu,I wonder where those ants are heading I wanna find out!,4237
Mutsu,I'll give it all I've got!,4237
Mutsu,Combined Fleet! Uhh move out!,4238
Mutsu,Mr. Kitty hang on tight! I'm gonna get serious!,4238
Mutsu,I want to protect my friends!,4239
Mutsu,Ever since Nagato and I were at Hashira Island I've wondered Why is the sky blue? Why can birds fly? Why do we fight?  There are so many things I wonder,4239
Mutsu,I know some things you're happier if you don't know about but I still want to know! Besides aren't there lots of things you're happier if you do know about them?,4240
Mutsu,What I wanted to ask was umm do you like me? Are my questions annoying? And Oh right! I wanted to say that I love you and I love all the friends I've made here!,4240
Mutsu,So this means we'll be together as one? That's amazing! It really does feel like I'm together with you when I look at this ring! Why's that?,4241

Mutsu,"Hmh? If fah foo Fummamuh? *gulp*. I'm not lazing around! I'm just checking on the pastries that just came in! What are you doing here anyway? To ""taste-test?"" Or is there something wrong with the pastries? Why?",4242

Mutsu,Hmm? Are you that hungry? Just give me a minute!,4243

Mutsu,Hombhimed Fheef! Faih fofh!,4244
Mutsu,I'm gonna give this to Nagato! Ehehe I'm talking about these sweets not the MVP!,4244
Mutsu,Sorry it was m-my fault,4245
Myoukou,If I get another chance I'd like to pet Hatsukaze's head again.,4245
Myoukou,Bergall?! Phew you were talking about someone else.,4246
Myoukou,I'm supervising the destroyers' training right now. Please save it for later if it's not an emergency.,4246
Myoukou, Please do this kind of thing to destroyers not me,4247
Myoukou,Don't call it a day after finishing just one mission!,4247
Myoukou,New mail has arrived! Is this the latest training manual?,4248
Myoukou,This method of relaxing is inefficient. Why not try some of my specially-made energy drink?,4248
Myoukou,Commission complete! Is everyone putting forward their best effort?,4249
Myoukou,I won't let such a small improvement get to my head.,4249
Myoukou,Let's see the fruits of my daily training! All guns open fire!,4250
Myoukou,This victory was made possible by everyone's efforts not just my own!,4250
Myoukou,It's all because I neglected my daily training Everyone I'm sorry,4251
Myoukou,Burn this final sight into your memory!,4251
Myoukou,It is not unusual for a weaker force to defeat a stronger one in a naval battle. Victory or defeat is often decided by good judgment and split-second decision making. We must be thorough in our training in order to cultivate these abilities.,4252
Myoukou,I saw your light on so I came to check on you. I had no idea you'd still be awake; even being a workaholic should have its limits! Come on I'm not leaving until you fall asleep.,4252
Nachi,I-I'm not training.. I'm just being lazy and laughing at the other girls as they work up a sweat.,4253
Nachi,What is it? Do you want to be my lackey?,4253
Nachi,My sisters in the Fifth Fleet? I miss them a bit err just once in a blue moon!,4254
Nachi,Ghosts on the training ground? W-what are you a kid? Who'd believe something like that?,4254
Nachi,Salt Lake City? I'm going to show her that Lady Luck doesn't bless the same person forever!,4255
Nachi,I-idiot you're that fascinated with me? At least tell me in advance,4255
Nachi,Only an idiot would be unable to complete such an easy mission.,4256
Nachi,Heheh looks like you couldn't have done this mission without me!,4256
Nachi,You want your mail? Only if you beg me nicely~,4257
Nachi,Good work. However you won't be able to catch up to me with even ten times the effort!,4257
Nachi,Mmhmm. It's important to work hard! Well unless you're me!,4258
Nachi,I'm even more flawless than before!,4258
Nachi,Hmph. Another bunch of blind idiots.,4259
Nachi,Hehe this is only normal of course.,4259
Nachi,Damn it just what went wrong?,4260
Nachi,Kneel before my cannons!,4260
Nachi,I wasn't talking to you!,4261
Nachi,Hard work? Not at all. A genius like me doesn't need to work hard. I get stronger just by breathing.,4261
Nachi,I know I have a hard time being honest with myself but I'll try my best to make you the happiest person in the world! I swear my name on it!,4262
Naganami,I give off warm and fuzzy vibes? Ehehe I've heard that from the others as well~ It's a little embarrassing Nuh uh I don't mind at all. I'm really glad to hear it!,4262
Naganami,Jintsuu is always so knowledgeable and reliable I wish I could be just like her,4263
Naganami,Lately everyone has been circulating rumors that hugging me or cuddling my tail has healing properties like coming out of a bath. They're even saying that it can cure colds There's no way that's true right?!,4263
Naganami,I'm more than just a ball of fluff you know? Look it's my smile and my ability to bring warmth to others that counts~,4264
Naganami,Mission complete! Great work today! Come come don't be shy – come rest on this big fluffy pillow!,4264
Naganami,I'm the flagship? All right just leave it to me!,4265
Naganami,I didn't even realize I got MVP But this was only possible because of everyone's hard work!,4265
Naganami,I'll have to work much harder if I want to become an ideal flagship,4266
Naganami,Try this torpedo strike on for size!,4266
Naganami,My friends are still fighting so I can't afford to go down here!,4267
Naganami,Everyone in the Mutsuki class is super fluffy and cute! Being at this port makes me so happy~!,4267
Naganami,My tail is warm and fluffy but Wakaba's is shinier in comparison Hatsushimo's is slender and Shimakaze's is tiny Um there are all different sorts!,4268
Naganami,Oyashio taught me a little trick! If I remember properly it goes a little like this! This circle on your forehead is supposed to make you luckier when it comes to your love life and also helps you become happier!,4268
Naganami,Still not enough good fortune in your life? You leave me no other choice then! Even if you have bad luck there's a way to compensate for it! I just have to pass it to you directly Mmwah~,4269
Naganami,Lately I've been wondering how I can bring more happiness to your life. As for the result C-come here! What could make anyone happier than eating sweet food in a soft fluffy embrace? I already have handmade chocolate and my well-groomed tail right here!,4269
Naganami,Now that the big day is here I'm awfully nervous I-I'll be in your care now and forever okay?,4270
Naganami,I've never done the san san kudo ceremony before. I hope I don't mess it up,4270
Naganami,My white kimono looks lovely? Why thank you. I'll cherish the memory of it for all my life.,4271
Naganami,Moving is rather difficult when I have to worry about my tail and the train Heehee! That's another fond memory to look back on.,4271
Naganami,You want to hold hands don't you? I'd be happy to!,4272
Naganami,If you want to cuddle up with me and my tail thenI don't mind. Indulge yourself.,4272
Naganami,It's time for a mission. I will naturally assist you. After all finishing it early means more quality time with you!,4273
Naganami,Well done on another completed mission! Now we can spend some time together just the two of us.,4273
Naganami,Welcome homed-dear! Calling you that now is still a little embarrassing!,4274
Naganami,For the happiness of those we love!,4274
Naganami,Akashi pushed me into getting this outfit saying that it would surely make you happy but What do you think?,4275
Naganami,I want to be a maid who can bring happiness to everyone! I'm going to have to work even harder to make that happen,4275
Naganami,Being able to go about business as usual in this kind of outfit is no easy feat Real maids are truly something,4276
Naganami,There's still some time before the banquet begins and I'm afraid I'm feeling a little sleepy W-would you mind if I took a nap? Thank you,4276
Naganami,You feel a sense of relief when you see me? I'm not quite sure what you mean by that but I'm glad that you're happy,4277
Naganami,It's not time for the party yet? Then um let's stay like this for a bit longer,4277
Naganami,*pant* *pant*,4278
Naganami,We've got new mail. I'm sure it's good news.,4278
Naganami,I I'll do my best!,4279
Naganami,I wanted to help you relieve some stress so I thought I would read some folk tales to you When I mentioned that Akashi suggested these clothes to me Wh-what do you think?,4279
Naganami,Tonight I'll be putting all my heart into reading all for your sake!,4280
Naganami,The sound of my voice puts you at ease? Th-that's great it was worth practicing ahead of time!,4280
Naganami,I wanted to surprise you so I'll be reading one of my personal favorites to you today. If there's something you want to listen to next time please let me know and I'll have it ready!,4281
Naganami,You want me to read the next story? S-sure I'd love to!,4281
Naganami,I-I'm going to lose my place!,4282
Naganami,No more~ No matter how much you want to keep listening to the story you need to prioritize your missions first!,4282
Naganami,You've finished your missions! Good job with them. Since you held tight and worked hard to complete them I've prepared lots of rewards for you~,4283
Naganami,Oh there's some new mail for us! I wonder if it's the storybooks I had ordered.,4283
Naganami,It's time for me to get serious!,4284
Nagara,You need to change clothes after getting soaked Hey do you want to borrow mine?,4284
Nagara,It's great that Abukuma is finally making friends but,4285
Nagara,If it's just taking a break once in a while I think I can let that go.,4285
Nagara,Commissions? That's part of my job too.,4286
Nagara,Oxygen Torpedoes..I want.,4286
Nagara,Who is the enemy this time?,4287
Nagara,I hope every battle goes as well as this one did~!,4287
Nagara,Hehe are you ready?,4288
Nagara,Hmm What should I cook for my little sisters tonight?,4288
Nagara,An escort? That's my specialty. And this time? Ah going to port with you undercover?!,4289
Nagara,My Valentine's chocolate turned out a bit dense so chew it well. Hehehe~ Poke poke~ You're so cute and charming when you eat. I might just make chocolate for you every day~,4289
Nagara,Whispering to you while cleaning your ear like this kind of makes it seem like we're a couple doesn't it? Hehe forget I said anything. All right all done. You can stay here and chat a bit more if you'd like~?,4290
Nagato,Welcome ba oww I bit my tongue,4290
Nagato,Everyone's faces are full of laughter here I think I am rather fond of this place!,4291
Nagato,Those who speak lightly of war do you think they are prepared to face the consequences of their actions?,4291
Nagato,I shall never forget the smiles on the faces of those people who were saved from calamity. That is the reason why I fight.,4292
Nagato,Is it acceptable to arrange the itinerary in this manner? I do not quite understand how to do it yet,4292
Nagato,The mission rewards Ngh! Phew is it acceptable to leave them here?,4293
Nagato,"What is this piece of paper? ""Mail?"" I see it's mail. Shall I read it?",4293
Nagato,I have never had to welcome anyone before. Perhaps I shall do so by firing my cannons?,4294
Nagato,The commission fleet has returned H-Hey I managed to remember the time. Have you no words of praise for me?,4294
Nagato,I hope to be able to welcome the day when we can all beat our swords into plowshares,4295
Nagato,Yet another tragic battle.,4295
Nagato,Impudent fools why did they have to provoke me?,4296
Nagato,Ugh I have failed once again,4296
Nagato,I am called Nagato Nagato of the Sakura Empire!,4297
Nagato,Your wish is to repeat the errors of the past once more? Very well I see,4297
Nagato,What do you require of me? Hmm? I am not doing anything in particular. After I handed the work to Yamato there is little to do except fight.,4298
Nagato,I should spend more time with the others? Even if I tried to do that I would not know how to behave and they would be afraid of me all the same Hey what are you doing why are you taking off my riggings?!,4298
Nagato,I see! I am less intimidating with my riggings taken off. I certainly do feel lighter but why does it feel like I've lost something like when I appointed Yamato to take over as flagship?,4299
Nagato,It is enough to be treasured by one person? Since you were the one who brought me out I shall have you take responsibility that is umm in other words I command you to treasure me if that is acceptable?,4299
Nagato,Happy Valentine's Day! Do accept my chocolate. This is a most special moment rarely seen B- because it is Valentine's Day and I have made for you this chocolate with mine own hands!,4300
Nagato,You. Come hither would you? Closer I say! *whispering* Good. I've now ascertained that you've received my chocolate. Why am I being so secretive about it? Because if Mutsu saw me doing it I would never hear the end to her questions!,4300
Nagato,The chocolate we give today symbolizes one's gratitude b-but there's another meaning? Then the chocolate I'm giving you represents both! That's right both meanings! I'm sure that's right,4301
Nagato,I-I refuse to let you say that you don't know the meanings behind my chocolate! And I know how you feel now like I know the back of my hand. You love my chocolate right?,4301
Nagato,It may be presumptuous of me but please take care of me from now on Is that acceptable? S-Somehow it feels a little embarrassing Ahaha,4302
Nagato,You are the only one who has the nerve to keep me waiting.,4302
Nagato,I am able to smile from the bottom of my heart when I am here. Yes I am very fond of this place!,4303
Nagato,I shall fight on! At long last I have discovered what it is that I fight for!,4303
Nagato,I shall never forget the warmth of the hands that pulled me out from the shackles of my armaments,4304
Nagato,What will the future hold in store? For the first time in my life I want to know the answer.,4304
Nagato,I never knew that being touched like this could bring me so much joy,4305
Nagato,Uuhh p-please not right there,4305
Nagato,I have arranged the tasks in accordance with your instructions.,4306
Nagato,My familiars helped bring the mail in. Ehehe they seem to have taken a liking to you.,4306
Nagato,Waiting for a beloved person to come back is a thing of joy as well hehe,4307
Nagato,A commission has been completed. Shall we take this opportunity to take a walk around the port?,4307
Nagato,For the sake of our futures!,4308
Nagato,My name is Nagato. Not the Nagato of the Sakura Empire but of you only. Because you were the one who reached out to me and pulled me from the depths of my loneliness I wish to always stay by your side. You won't reject me right?,4308
Nagato,Good timing. I require your assistance in locating my lost clothes Just so you know I did not misplace them because I was playing around understood?!,4309
Nagato,I sometimes envy Mutsu Even though I have my freedom now unlike when I was placed upon a pedestal and worshipped I can't be carefree like her,4309
Nagato,Perfect you have arrived. As long as you are here the usual moon-watching will prove to be much more enjoyable Why don't you stay here today and rest for a while?,4310
Nagato,What do you plan to do today? Do call upon me if you need my help.,4310
Nagato,Th-there's no need to be in a hurry to go outside right? It's spacious quiet and warm here and you are authorized to pat my fluffy friend.,4311
Nagato,The moon can be freely enjoyed throughout the year but there are few opportunities for the two of us to gaze at the moon together,4311
Nagato,Mutsu? Let her go out and play. Unlike Kawakaze she has no awareness of her surroundings Ah b-but don't let her hear I said that!,4312
Nagato,Moon-viewing sake? This has indeed been quite popular but I Ah f-forget it! If you want to drink then treat yourself! after all I'm not allowed to,4312
Nagato,Do you wish to comment upon my attire? Hehe don't underestimate the skill of the Sakura Empire's craftspeople!,4313
Nagato,Prostrate yourself before the might of the Sakura Empire!,4313
Nagato,"I heard that it is custom to play a ""sport"" at this kind of event involving throwing pillows at others. Heheh then I shall put the might of the Big Seven on display!",4314
Nagato,"I have been informed that the things known as ""party games"" are quite enjoyable in the company of others. Will you instruct me on how to play them?",4314
Nagato,I've been so looking forward to sharing a dinner table with everyone else! Y-you should join us as well!,4315
Nagato,I can't help but to feel like being so carefree will hinder my work,4315
Nagato,Phew Being able to play with everyone s a lot of fun but I am a bit jealous of Mutsu's boundless energy.,4316
Nagato,A mock pillow fight? Very well allow me to demonstrate the Big Seven's Ack! Mutsu don't start throwing things before I've finished talking!,4316
Nagato,Hehehe You alone shall be the target of my pillow barrages.,4317
Nagato,Mm the ingredients have been successfully purchased. I know not what delicacies can be made from these but I am looking forward to the results!,4317
Nagato,Though this is a splendorous dress befitting the occasion it is too different from my usual attire Mutsu and Mikasa have nothing but praise for it? If you say so then perhaps I can take your word. Hehe.,4318
Nagato,I do not mean to grumble about the attire you chose for me but I wonder if Mutsu and the others might get the wrong idea. S-say What was your motive for making me change into this?,4318
Nagato,I am not sure I will be able to maintain my dignity in this outfit Stop teasing me already! You may think it's fine b-but at least save it for when we're alone,4319
Nagato,Musashi handles most of what I ask of her but she seems to see my requests as a spoiled child's begging,4319
Nagato,Do rest well on this day. I won't abide you pestering me to relax without following your own advice.,4320
Nagato,Does something trouble you? If it is beyond my power to help you are free to ask Umikaze or Kawakaze.,4320

Naka,I'm really powerful you know!,4340
Naka,Everyone stay calm! Let's change our strategy!,4341
Naka,My sisters chose you because you just let them mess around without being scolded? How strange,4341

Nürnberg,Am I being too hard on you? What should I do If I was to make you upset with me W-well I'm sure it's fine since you're probably thinking up all kinds of weird things right now!,4347
Nürnberg,Are are you trying to condition me to be less cautious by touching me?!,4348

Nürnberg,I hope all this hard work pays off,4349

Nürnberg,I wish Leipzig was here as well Well she's never been good with crowded places though,4356
Nürnberg,I never knew the Sakura Empire's food was this delicious Yeah I'll have to ask my friends how to make these.,4356
Nürnberg,Y-you want to hold my hand?! Are you sure it's just so we don't get separated?,4357
Nautilus,Submarines were born in an attempt to imitate the nautilus. When you look at things that way the ideas for a lot of inventions were derived from animals.,4357
Nautilus,I wish I could dive deeper and get to know the secrets of the sea,4358
Nautilus,Y-you're acting awfully suspicious,4358
Nautilus,Nautilus is not a small animal,4359

Nelson,Hmph. Are you done lazing around? I sorted out your documents so I'm hoping you'll get some things done.,4367
Nelson,What are you staring at?! Keep it up and I'll gouge your eyes out!,4368
Nelson,"Experience from what's known as ""failure""? Only a loser would say something like that!",4368
Nelson,"I'm not just talking about you but those who wave around empty words of ""friendship"" and ""efforts"" do not belong here.",4369
Nelson,One should only do work one is capable of. You still don't have what it takes to be entrusted with important tasks Keep honing your skills.,4369
Nelson,Are you trying to get a taste of my cannons?!,4370
Nelson,Why are you daydreaming if there are still missions to complete?,4370
Nelson,Are you trying to make me get the rewards for you? I'll give you 10 seconds to do it yourself! 1 2,4371
Nelson,I picked up your mail while I was out on my walk. Read it and be thankful.,4371
Nelson,Have you witnessed the might of the Royal Navy?,4372

Nelson,Hmph. Enemies like these aren't even worth the time.,4373
Nelson,To humiliate me like this I'll get you back!,4374
Nelson,You're making a big mistake if you think I'm going to underestimate our enemies!,4374
Nelson,Hmph this is nothing!,4375
Nelson,I don't even know what to tell you anymore *Sigh*,4375
Nelson,Just with results like these you want me to You did all this yourself? Don't laugh! I suppose I can make an exception and admit that you did well this time. Hmph!,4376
Nelson,What are you looking at? I do approve of people who take of their work seriously. Besides in the beginning I just thought you were unreliable I never said you weren't serious!,4376
Nelson,Go out on a date? Well It's not as if I won't as long as you keep on working hard then,4377
Nelson,Stand straight and puff your chest. You are the one I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with. This is something you should be proud of!  Of course to be chosen by you is my honor I'm not arrogant anymore?  W-why you Do you want me to beat you up that badly?!,4377
Nelson,Here chocolate. Since you usually work pretty hard a little reward ought to increase your motivation? I-it's not like I especially made it for you or anything,4378
Nelson,Here it's the Valentine's chocolate you wanted. Have you been having trouble with work lately? You should eat some sweets now and then to cheer you up I- How am I supposed to know what you're eating?!,4378
Nelson,Here your Valentine's chocolate. I'm amazed that you never tire of receiving it year after year Come again? You were even looking forward to it?! Excuse me? And what if I HADN'T made any this time? What would you have done then?,4379
Nelson,It's become such a bother picking out new chocolate for you every year so for once I made some myself. For the record I only put in the bare minimum amount of effort so curb your expectations! You're just glad to receive a handmade gift? Good lord aren't you easily pleased!,4379
Nelson,This costume *Sigh* whatever. It's Halloween so some kind of entertainment is to be expected. But listen here: I'm not dressing up because I WANT to participate okay?!,4380
Nelson,I'll overlook your slacking at least for Halloween. But when this day is over you don't get to slack off any more!,4380
Nelson,I wasn't really planning on dressing up at all. I was just a little curious so I-it looks good on me?  T-thanks Hey don't get carried away!,4381
Nelson,Stop taking pictures Rodney! I don't want people to see me like this!,4381
Nelson,I guess it's okay to have fun with everyone like this sometimes What? Did I say something funny?,4382
Nelson,What are you standing around for? It's a holiday; don't you have better things to do?,4382
Nelson,If you try anything weird at all then you'll be in a world of pain!,4383
Nelson,Do you wanna end up like this pumpkin?!,4383
Nelson,W-what are you gawking at?! What's so weird about my costume?!,4384
Nelson,Hey are you even enjoying yourself? At least pretend to have fun when I went out of my way to invite you or else I'm going to lose sleep over this! Look behind me? What are you– Oh!,4384
Nelson,Make this day count you hear? Y-you should know how to celebrate a holiday. You're not THAT stupid,4385
Nelson,Rodney's with Colorado's group – they went to the shooting gallery. We can check that out if you want M-me get lost among the crowd? Like that would ever happen! Especially when you know we're holding hands,4385
Nelson,"Look those girls are dancing. Heehee they seem to be having fun. That's the ""Awa Dance"" if I remember right.",4386
Nelson,I will compliment the Sakura Empire on its impressive craftsmanship. Just look at their blue dyes and this tailor-made yukata.,4386
Nelson,These fireworks are gorgeous You are looking at them right? I don't want to stand here and watch them all alone N-no I don't mean that the way you think!,4387
Nelson,That's quite a few missions. Shouldn't you entrust some of these to other people?,4387
Nelson,I tasked the manjuus with collecting those rewards because I don't want you to leave N-no I didn't mean it like that!,4388
Nelson,You just witnessed the might of the Royal Navy! Ack! Y-you did NOT just see me trip! Got it?,4388
Nelson,A commission should be completed by now? Y-yeah I know! I don't need you to remind me!,4389
Nelson,You'll have to shape up if you want to go out with me. Firstly you Look I've told you a dozen times by now! This is not a date you're just giving me a guided tour around the festival grounds!,4389
Neptune,Want to know about this? It's called a trident. Don't you think it's cool?,4390

Neptune,You would like to challenge me to a game? Very well. Do not expect me to hold back though hehe~,4391
Neptune,You've done well to return home safe and sound.,4391
Neptune,As expected!,4392

Neptune,Ehehe~ As a special service I shall allow you to praise me more~,4393
Neptune,I shall not repeat this mistake again.,4393
Neptune,I have no intention of getting friendly with the enemy~,4394
Neptune,I seem to have underestimated the battlefield,4394
Neptune,"You are my world? Did you think you could fool me with such flattery? Ehehe well I suppose there's a chance that I would let you fool me~ But first you would have to repeat it ten times nay a hundred times~""",4395
Neptune,My daily routine is nothing but missions and sorties so it’s nice to be able to get dressed up and have a good time. Hehe~,4395
Neptune,Since joining the fleet I’ve made a lot of friends. Especially Shropshire — she’s both a good friend and a good rival.,4396
Neptune,How uncouth spoiling the mood like this,4396
Neptune,That's right the party venue is right in front of you. Heehee~,4397
Neptune,Welcome back. Now then please take my hand once more. Oh Is the trident getting in the way?,4397
Neptune,Was I too preoccupied with putting on airs?,4398
Nevada,Hey get your spirits up!,4398

Nevada,You are still way off!,4404
Nevada,I'm a bit disappointed in you,4404
Nevada,I'm quite confident in my own luck. Want to gamble a bit?,4405
Nevada,The idea behind priority defenses? That is to protect our most important areas What you want to know how important they are? W-well if it's you,4405
Nevada,Oh you what are you doing getting so bold at a time like this? Have you never considered the time and place for such an important thing? Hmph. yeah yeah. I'm not saying no so bring it.,4406
Nevada,Yo young man! You want some of my handmade chocolate? Sure it looks a little funny but it tastes like the real deal! C'mon!,4406
Nevada,I made you a comparatively small chocolate cake this year 'round keeping your dietary needs in mind young'un. Originally I planned on making a big cake and give everyone a slice but Oklahoma told me not to for whatever reason You got any clue as to why that is young'un?,4407
Nevada,Howdy young'un! Gettin' all that chocolate for Valentine's Day can be a bit rough huh? Here I got some stomach medicine that you might be needin' tomorrow y'know just in case~,4407
Nevada,Young'un you definitely want to get chocolate on Valentine's Day right? That's why I got a hot cocoa blend for you. It's got all the flavor of chocolate but isn't sickeningly sweet. Good stuff right?,4408
Nevada,Young'un you want some proper chocolate on Valentine's Day don't ya? Well can't blame ya. It's your wish and it's my job to grant it. Here have a family-sized bag of mini-chocolates! I'd be surprised if this ruffled any of the other girls' feathers.,4408
Nevada,Heh with this I won't be outperformed by those fancy greenhorn battleships. Young'un from now on just leave everything to Nevada here!,4409
Nevada,Nevada always ready for your orders!,4409
Nevada,That Oklahoma she's ain't so wet behind the ears anymore. Soon she's gonna be all independent.,4410
Nevada,Though fighting can't eliminate every problem in the world it certainly can eliminate most of those who would cause problems.,4410
Nevada,So you fancy a dance with the devil? As you can see I'm ready to up the ante. Young'un what are you going to wager?,4411
Nevada,Young'un want to experience a bridal carry for yourself?,4411
Nevada,As long I am here there's no way we can lose!,4412
Nevada,Your offenses are weak your defenses are feeble! Your reactions are slow and your movements are sluggish! Come back when you've trained more!,4412
Nevada,Howdy young'un! Aren't you tired from goin' around greetin' fancy people? Come over here and relax with me and some good food.,4413
Nevada,Here already young'un? I reckon we oughta get to work then.,4413
Nevada,Y'know that seamstress asked me what I wanted and I told her I wanted my dress to focus on defense. Look how that turned out But hey I kinda like it. It's easy to move in.,4414
Nevada,There's somethin' that gets me real emotional about seein' Oklahoma chat it up with friends.,4414
Nevada,I know you're real busy with work but how about you work on that stamina? You haven't eaten one bite since you've been runnin' around talkin' to people. Here eat up!,4415
Nevada,You wanna make a wager? I don't have much to bet in this getup Oh I know! Whoever loses has to stay for another drink! How's that young'un?,4415

Nevada,You've got mail young'un. What's it say?,4418
Nevada,You look beat. Hahaha how's about I help out and let you lie your pretty little head in my lap? C'mon don't be shy now!,4418
New_Orleans,Being focused is a good thing but overworking yourself will only burn you out in the end.,4419
New_Orleans,I suppose rigging rocket boosters are still a way's off Oh just talking to myself.,4419

Newcastle,I'm no good at these cat and mouse games. Sigh Why don't you just have a seat and we'll talk like normal people?,4432

Newcastle,It's all right you can go back to sleep. You're free to rest on me as long as you like if it comforts you. Rest until your strength has fully– Oh dear someone sounds hungry. Hehehe~ Then may I interest you in some Valentine's chocolate?,4443

Newcastle,My quiet peaceful life has been riled like these waves and you need to take responsibility for that.,4444

Newcastle,Do we have time to call up my sisters to join us for some teppanyaki?,4449
Newcastle,It's nice I can push all the maid work onto my sisters but spending the whole day reading a book by myself is a tad dull,4450
Newcastle,I've heard summertime is when you see a certain type of rose blooming But I'm not sure if our port has that particular rose?,4450
Newcastle,It's what it is But if you keep at this my outfit is going to get ruined,4451
Newcastle,If it's the outfit you're interested in Sigh I suppose it's too late to stop you at this point?,4451
Newcastle,Are you tired after all that? Then let me service you with a powerful healing hug.,4452

Nicoloso_da_Recco,I bought a new map! No I paid for it myself out of my own pocket. Making maps is what I do for a hobby!,4484

Niizuki,If I cause you any trouble I'll let you touch my ears and my tail so please don't get mad at me,4489
Niizuki,For this one you do this then here you do this I think? I-I hope this will work,4489
Niizuki,A real battle I'll give it my all!,4490
Niizuki,I hope I didn't cause any trouble for anyone,4490
Niizuki,I've failed yet again,4491
Niizuki,I-I'm not mistaken here am I?!,4491
Niizuki,I knew I probably wouldn't be of any use to you,4492
Niizuki,I'm trying my best not to cause trouble for people but I don't know how So instead I ended up making a lot of mistakes,4492
Niizuki,Ever since I came to your base I've started making considerably fewer mistakes But even when I do you don't get mad at me so I've slowly but surely been able to get better Also when you encourage me by stroking my ears your hand feels so warm,4493
Ning_Hai,Where were you? Lazing around again?! Did you bring me any food? Hmph. Let's get to work.,4493
Ning_Hai,What is it? You want to watch a martial arts performance?,4494
Ning_Hai,Even if you put a giant plate of steamed buns on the table in front of me I won't relax,4494
Ning_Hai,You cannot protect your loved ones if you neglect your training.,4495
Ning_Hai,What you want to have a go with me?,4495
Ning_Hai,*sigh* I won't forgive you even if you beg God for forgiveness and bribe me with a lifetime supply of steamed buns.,4496
Ning_Hai,Missions won't complete themselves if you are daydreaming. Let's get going!,4496
Ning_Hai,Reading the mail in a timely manner is a common courtesy. Make sure to properly respond as well!,4497
Ning_Hai,I just finished steaming these buns. Why not relax and have a quick snack?,4497
Ning_Hai,I've got to work even harder to balance the fleet's income and expenses.,4498
Ning_Hai,I'll never hold back against our enemies!,4498
Ning_Hai,Everyone must aspire to outperform me!,4499
Ning_Hai,My abilities are inadequate,4499
Ning_Hai,I'll show you the power of kung fu!,4500
Ning_Hai,Persevere!,4500
Ning_Hai,As if I'd eat your buns!,4501
Ning_Hai,You won't trick me this time! I'm telling you Eh? You like me? Wait th-this must be your new way of tricking me! Uu,4501
Ning_Hai,"There's an old saying in our nation: ""It's easy to go from a life of frugality to one of extravagance but not the other way around."" I hope that the one I like would not turn me into a frivolous wh-wh-why would I say that I like you? You must have heard me wrong.",4502
Ning_Hai,I have no idea how these Western holidays got so popular Anyway this is for you. Ping Hai and I made it for you. Make sure to eat it all up! I won't let you off the hook easily if I catch you wasting food!,4502
Ning_Hai,Now that I think about it chocolates are very reasonable. The raw materials are cheap and if you don't pay attention to the appearance they don't take much work I've decided! This year I'm going to make a ton of chocolate!,4503
Ning_Hai,This year's chocolate is on a whole other level compared to last year's. It's an elite item the result of years of research and development with a sprinkle of ingenuity accelerated by my feelings for you! I dub thee Super legendary luxury chocolate! Taste the world of infinite possibilities within!,4503
Ning_Hai,Where in the world did Bunbun get these fancy glasses I hope he's not trying to become a pandit.,4504
Ning_Hai,I'll be everyone's role model!,4504
Ning_Hai,How'd I even get lost? My map of the local sea should be perfectly accurate,4505
Ning_Hai,Come here Ping Hai. Let me take care of that stain on your lips.,4505
Ning_Hai,Ping Hai! You can't get careless just because we're not in batt– Blurph!,4506
Ning_Hai,I'm tired and my muscles hurt But it was all worth it for that awesome beachside barbeque!,4506
Ning_Hai,My summer appetite empowers me!,4507
Ning_Hai,You're not taking my fried noodles from me!,4507
Ning_Hai,I want another helping of seafood with fried noodles!,4508
Ning_Hai,Happy Mid-Autumn Festival! By the way I heard that if you prayed to the moon today you'll become as pretty as the Goddess of the Moon! Eh you're really doing it?!,4508
Ning_Hai,Oh gosh mooncake! Yes! Om nom nom nom!,4509
Ning_Hai,It's a holiday so nobody will mind if I drink a little right? *gulp* *gulp* Ahahaha Something here smells like sweet osmanthus~!,4509
Ning_Hai,Da Bao Baobao do you want some mooncake too? Here you go.,4510
Ning_Hai,For the last time! I'm not a bunny girl I'm a moon rabbit! Got it?!,4510
Ning_Hai,"We haven't had to worry as much about things like food since we joined the fleet but that doesn't mean we can just throw money around! Anyway I'm the older of the ""Dragon Sisters"" Ning Hai! Great to be here!",4511
Ning_Hai,Look all this idol stuff is just work okay! Don't start thinking I actually enjoy it!,4511
Ning_Hai,After studying all that kung fu Idol dancing is a piece of cake for me and Ping Hai! Hah hah!,4512
Ning_Hai,Don't worry I'm wearing shorts underneath. And anyway if somebody tried something gross I've got a roundhouse kick with their name on it!,4512
Ning_Hai,Roundhouse kick!,4513
Ning_Hai,A new offer? Heh hehehehe Sure I'll keep packing in as much work as my schedule can take!,4513
Ning_Hai,The fans make me really happy sure but next time I'll have to teach them how to save money!,4514
Ning_Hai,There's so many fan letters! Being an idol is so exhausting,4514
Ning_Hai,Nice work out there got a request you want me to sing?,4515
Ning_Hai,Is making me sing during a battle some kind of weird fetish thing?!,4515
Ning_Hai,It feels even better than I expected.,4516
Ning_Hai,Oh my outfit,4516
Ning_Hai,Where should we go next?,4517
Ning_Hai,I've vaguely felt it since way back but the Sakura Empire and Dragon Empery are similar in a lot of ways. But also dissimilar in many ways obviously. Those are what feel fresh.,4517
Ning_Hai,It's so crowded over here Listen um could you hold my hand?  I mean with me.,4518
Ning_Hai,This one's really expensive But we do need a souvenir to take back home Fine we'll buy it!,4518
Ning_Hai,You're late! We're going to the next tourist attraction right now!,4519
Ning_Hai,Stop interfering with our vacation you scrapheaps!,4519
Ning_Hai,You're willing to go *any* lengths to anger me aren't you?,4520
Ning_Hai,Yat Sen said this look would be best for a party but is it really okay? I'm not used to having my hair down like this,4520
Ning_Hai,Yat Sen Ping Hai and I made this cake for the party with the help of some other girls. It had to be big enough to feed everyone But a big baozi probably would have been better than a big cake Ahem! N-never mind.,4521
Ning_Hai,Da Bao! Bring the next slice over here! Pay attention!,4521
Ning_Hai,I told her not to but I'm still worried Ping Hai is going to gobble up the cake before she finishes passing it out I better go keep an eye on her!,4522
Ning_Hai,While handing out all this cake I realized just how many friends Ping Hai and I have made lately Heh heh.,4522
Ning_Hai,A party this fancy must have cost a lot Hm Fine! The money's spent so we might as well enjoy ourselves!,4523
Ning_Hai,You're not getting this cake!,4523
Ning_Hai,I never knew pandas are omnivores. I'd always thought they only ate bamboo,4524
Ning_Hai,Have some bamboo too Da Bao. Eat it slowly now so you don't choke!,4524
Ning_Hai,These cubs might not look all that heavy but they weigh a lot for their size.,4525
Ning_Hai,A baozi? You're not supposed to feed pandas with stuff you'd feed Ping! It's for me? In that case th-thanks,4525
Ning_Hai,The mommy panda is pretty wary of letting people near her babies What would her caretakers do in this situation?,4526
Norfolk,I'm so embarrassed,4526
Norfolk,I don't like the winter,4527
Norfolk,If everyone doesn't get along then that's no good.,4527
Norfolk,Did I do something wrong?,4528
Norfolk,It seems a commission's been completed.,4528
Norfolk,I'll give it my utmost,4529
Norfolk,Is it really fine for me to receive such an honor?,4529
Norfolk,*Cries* I'm not so suitable for combat after all,4530
Norfolk,I'll g-give it my utmost!,4530
Norfolk,Mm I too want to stay with you forever and ever,4531
Norfolk,I-I made this Valentine's chocolate with Indianapolis Er I mean Indy. She's so kind and attentive A-and it was fun to teach her how to make it Hehehe,4531
Norfolk,I don't much like winter at all but I do like Valentine's Day despite that. A big part of that is When I'm making chocolate for you I get this warm sensation that fills my body Say if I told you my recipe would you want to make the chocolate with me next time? Hehehe~,4532
North_Carolina,Welcome back~,4532
North_Carolina,Being stared like that makes me a bit shy,4533
North_Carolina,What do I wear inside? It's not something that’s so significant,4533
North_Carolina,If I think about it I certainly have been to many places seen many landscapes and also parted ways with many people.,4534
North_Carolina,Sometimes I get so envious of my younger sister Washington and how she’s so energetic all the time.,4534
North_Carolina,Do you need help with something?,4535
North_Carolina,Not good,4535
North_Carolina,It’s not good to leave tasks unfinished.,4536
North_Carolina,The mission rewards were sent out are you not going to pick it up?,4536
North_Carolina,You’ve got new mail~,4537
North_Carolina,Ah hold on your collar is all messed up. Stand still while I fix it there you go~ (waves).,4537
North_Carolina,The commission is over they should be back soon~,4538
North_Carolina,I'll try to work a bit harder~,4538
North_Carolina,Don’t be overconfident and try not to be so nervous while focusing on winning~,4539
North_Carolina,Not so successful let's try again next time.,4539
North_Carolina,Never let your guard down.,4540
North_Carolina,Sisters hold on!,4540
North_Carolina,If you’re only going by appearances every child in this fleet looks cute. But in terms of personality they all have their unique quirks. To be honest I am a bit envious of them. (strokes chin).,4541
North_Carolina,Here Valentine's Chocolate. I made it myself but there's not much special about it Sigh Why does even my chocolate turn out so plain,4541
North_Carolina,Just adding flair to my chocolate isn't good enough so I'm always thinking up creative ways of presenting the goods to you. After all where's the thrill in just handing it over? Hehe~,4542
North_Carolina,Welcome back dear! Is there anything you need a hand with?,4542
North_Carolina,"Do I wear this all the time""? Maybe maybe not. I'll leave the answer up to your imagination.",4543
North_Carolina,Whew. This feels so liberating! And not in any indecent sense or anything.,4543
North_Carolina,Did Washington manage a proper smile today? She's got features as sharp as a knife so it's easy to misinterpret her expression.,4544
North_Carolina,I am genuinely interested in bunny girl things but it's quite awkward to actually tell people about them,4544
North_Carolina,I'll take that to mean you really like this outfit am I right? Hehehe~,4545
North_Carolina,It's true – you need the ears or you can't call yourself a bunny girl. Hehehe~,4545
North_Carolina,Could you help out with my ribbon? It's a bit too close for my liking Ah thank you.,4546
North_Carolina,Maybe I should keep this outfit on and give the commission team a real surprise when they return Hehehe~ I'm just joking.,4546
North_Carolina,Victory isn't the result of individuality. It's the result of good teamwork. Hehehe~,4547
Northampton,My armor's gotten thicker but it feels like I'm more exposed than before,4547
Northampton,You'll start to calm down if you just sit and listen to the waves,4548
Northampton,Houston you're too loud! Pipe the hell down!,4548
Northampton,Hold on I'm thinking about something,4549
Northampton,Um I'm a little ticklish right there,4549
Northampton,Looks like that mission hasn't been completed yet. Let me handle it!,4550
Northampton,Rewards have arrived. You should check them out.,4550
Northampton,Nobody got left behind right? Then the fleet's safely made it back.,4551
Northampton,Hey you have a commission that's been completed.,4551
Northampton,Thank you. I'll have you rewarded for this later.,4552
Northampton,The battle horn has sounded! C'mon let's go!,4552
Northampton,I never thought I'd be able to do something like this,4553
Northampton,I knew we couldn't win that easily,4553
Northampton,This is it!,4554
Northampton,I'm getting distracted here so do you think you could be quiet for a bit?,4554
Northampton,I'm not really the talkative type but if you're still willing to be my friend then maybe,4555
Northampton,I have a buddy who's a bit noisy and little sisters who are pretty rowdy so having a friend like you who's rather quiet feels pretty unusual,4555
Northampton,Smiling? I guess it's true that I rarely smile I'm a pretty stubborn girl and I don't have many friends Hm If you like girls who smile then I'll try to do that every now and then,4556
Northampton,You finally realized it didn't you you dense man But to be fair I never had the courage to put it into words either A-anyway from now on let's work together as dense partners in love shall we?,4556
Northampton,I don't think anything can express gratitude better than Valentine's chocolate 'cause it speaks volumes more than words do. I hope you'll get what my feelings are after you've tasted this.,4557
Northampton,Does it even need to be explained just how much emotion goes into Valentine's chocolate? Oh but then again we're both a bit dense so maybe I SHOULD lay it out clearly. Or you could guess how much.,4557
Noshiro,My you're quite early today. For starters how about checking today's schedule?,4558
Noshiro,Regardless of the situation you should first calm down think of a way forward and only then act. That's how I tackle things.,4558
Noshiro,Let's try thinking of some recipes for tomorrow's meals,4559
Noshiro,Keeping everything neat and tidy shortens the time it takes to search for documents. Why don't we start by organizing the documents on your desk?,4559
Noshiro,Agano's exp Yes it's truly impossible to tell what's behind that fearless smile She always ends up leading me around by the nose.,4560
Noshiro,If you're stuck why not stop what you're doing and instead think of a different way to proceed?,4560
Noshiro,R-Regarding your conduct right now I demand that you apologize and reflect upon your actions!,4561
Noshiro,If you feel overwhelmed by the number of missions why not try sorting them based on priority?,4561
Noshiro,I've received the mission rewards. Please double check that nothing has been left out.,4562
Noshiro,Mail? I'll check to make sure there's nothing suspicious inside.,4562
Noshiro,Hm Ah sorry. I was lost in thought. So you've returned. Let's start by reviewing this past battle.,4563
Noshiro,Please form the next commission team okay?,4563
Noshiro,Please strengthen my combat ability.,4564
Noshiro,Please look over the battle plans just to double check.,4564
Noshiro,If you lead with careful analysis and accurate decision-making your victory is ensured.,4565
Noshiro,We have no choice but to pull back,4565
Noshiro,Now's the time!,4566
Noshiro,An enemy trap?!,4566
Noshiro,You seem to be in quite the hurry. For once why don't you try calming down and reflecting upon your actions?,4567
Noshiro,I am currently contemplating over the last practice exercise. Do you not also have things you should be doing right now?,4567
Noshiro,An invitation to a joint practice session together from Agano How troubling. It's full of intent to bully. Even though I want to refuse I can't think of an excuse. Instead would you be willing to assign some official duties to me around that time?,4568
Noshiro,"Ahem. I'm only asking this because I keep hearing my friends use the term over and over but out of curiosity what exactly is this concept called `a woman's intuition'? ""I have absolutely no clue"" you say? I see. I guess it's an enigma to you too.",4568
Noshiro,So this is what it feels like to have your heart throb. While I used to be just as inexperienced with this feeling as I was experienced with being perceptive and relying on my instincts Yes it's all clear to me now. My feelings as well as yours.,4569
Noshiro,In order to not just accept your feelings but to reciprocate them as well Umm let's see I'll need to prepare meals go on dates on days off but I also need to make sure I don't lose motivation for my regular duties like practice Eh? Ah sorry I got lost in my train of thought. Huh? I-I should keep going?,4569
Noshiro,Here's my Valentine's chocolate. Since I'm the one giving this to you you should say something first Otherwise my words for you might be a bit long-winded Anyway what do you think about me?,4570
Noshiro,Phew If the topic about chocolate hadn't come up the two of us would've been working late into the night. Turns out you're just like me always taking things too seriously hehe. Here you've been looking forward to trying this right? This chocolate's for you. So wanna spend some time together until the sun sets?,4570
Noshiro,Don't play dumb now. You're the one who called me here and made a face like you're begging for chocolate. I guess I can't blame you too much since I came straight here when you called me but Here. It's the chocolate you want so much. What next? Knowing you you wouldn't just accept it and send me on my way now would you?,4571
Noshiro,Receiving everyone's blessings is truly a deeply moving experience. But for now let's set everything else aside and partake of our sweet bliss. After all you're not just a spectator anymore – we're in this ride together hehe~,4571
Noshiro,You said you'd be the one to escort me today did you not? Here take my hand Mhm.,4572
Noshiro,Agano did say that it's important to have a certain degree of flashiness but isn't this carriage just overkill? Well if you think it's apropos I'm fine with it too. Hehe.,4572
Noshiro,I'm pretty thirsty Maybe some tea or coffee Wait I shouldn't. I won't be able to sleep if I drink too much. Oh the same is true for you?,4573
Noshiro,What should we start off with today? Don't always make it about work. Isn't it about time you let me do something nice for you?,4573
Noshiro,You look like you're having a hard time If there's anything bothering me I can hear you out you know? If I made a face like that Agano wouldn't let me hear the end of it Hehe.,4574
Noshiro,Hm? Oh sorry. I didn't realize you called,4574
Noshiro,What's up?,4575
Noshiro,Still getting overwhelmed by work huh? Hmph you're as clumsy as ever. Guess I'll come help too.,4575
Noshiro,Mission accomplished. Why don't you leave the rest to me and take a break?,4576
Noshiro,Here's the mail. You know I was thinking it'd be nice if you'd write me some Err n-nevermind,4576
Noshiro,Welcome back. Hehe. To be honest my feet are a bit sore. Do you think it was bad for me to wait here for you like a princess?,4577
Noshiro,Next up is welcoming back everyone from the commission team right? Let's get going.,4577
Noshiro,Second Torpedo Squadron heading out!,4578
Noshiro,I'm perfectly calm. Aren't you the one excited over the victory?,4578
Noshiro,My face is all red? That's probably because of how tightly you're holding me. Don't you ever get tired of me? I love you hehe~,4579
Noshiro,Just as I thought this is the perfect place for watching fireworks. You came here thinking that too didn't you?,4579
Noshiro,It'll be a bit of a walk but won't you come along with me?,4580
Noshiro,I only found this place by pure chance. Thinking back on it I wonder how I was feeling when I stumbled upon this back alleyway instead of following the main road,4580
Noshiro,Please watch your step. The road is very narrow.,4581
Noshiro,If we're talking about dressing up properly for the festival this is definitely the getup. However I struggled a bit while changing into this. I even got laughed at by Agano. *sigh*,4581
Noshiro,Hm Ah I'll be fine even if you don't prop me up like that. Um thank you very much.,4582
Noshiro,Apologize and reflect upon your actions. Don't think that you're going to get away with it just because we're at a festival!,4582
Noshiro,Where were you all this time? Don't tell me you got lost?,4583
Noshiro,Now let's put on a dazzling show!,4583
Noshiro,Phew Go on fly away little ones. Mind the cage on your way out now I've been taking care of these guys. What have you been up to?,4584
Noshiro,Don't worry. There's nothing for you to worry about. All the preparations for the party and the related formalities have all been taken care of. All that's left for you to do is to enjoy the evening while savoring this beautiful scenery.,4584
Noshiro,Wah! Sorry. I can't believe I almost fell Um T-Thank you for catching me,4585
Noshiro,It's a given that I love the atmosphere here but another reason I like this place is that I feel like I can finally get away from Agano's endless teasing here Though I'd rather she just stop worrying about me in the first place,4585
Noshiro,This is yet another massive set built right in the Port. Yes it's incredibly gorgeous Honestly when I saw it for the first time I forgot I was in still in the Port for a moment. Speaking of which didn't you also stand and stare in awe when you first came here?,4586
Noshiro,Hehe. I think even Agano would take a liking to this place too.,4586
Noshiro,Excuse me How about I give you a massage with this?,4587
Noshiro,Once you've rested up why don't we go and make our appearance at the party together?,4587
Noshiro,Though it might not seem that way we're actually pretty close to the Port. Shall we go and greet the Commissions Team?,4588
Noshiro,Freeze and turn to ice Your time is up.,4588
Noshiro,In the face of well-crafted plans resistance is futile. Accept your defeat.,4589
Noshiro,Hmm I wonder what kind of scene this set is supposed to depict. A birdcage crows the sea blue roses and you beside me Um Don't you think this is quite picturesque?,4589
Noshiro,Whew Oh are you cold by any chance? I have some hot tea for you if you'd like. If you want someone to chat with I'd be glad to keep you company.,4590
Noshiro,It's good to see you. How should we start the day off?,4590
Noshiro,You still haven't taken a sip yet. Is it too hot? Are you perhaps bad with hot things?,4591
Noshiro,It's not like I'm opposed to going into battle as a warship but I'd really like to save people as well. Much like Hamakaze's always done.,4591
Noshiro,There's really no reason to push yourself to get some work done today. It's a precious day off so why don't you enjoy it for a change?,4592
Noshiro,Sigh Of course you would do that.,4592
Noshiro,Welcome back. Oh I know you're thirsty but the tea's a bit hot. Take care not to burn yourself.,4593
Noshiro,Though the snow has piled up this much it'll all melt with the coming of spring—becoming water that will nourish nascent life. I don't think I can remain cold like this for much longer either. After all before I was able to notice spring has managed to start creeping into my life too.,4593
Noshiro,Why don't you unwind for a bit before you start reflecting on the day's happenings? I'm sure it'll be far more efficient that way.,4594
Noshiro,Phew Now then let's prepare ourselves for the work ahead of us.,4594
Noshiro,What is there to drink Maybe some tea or coffee? No I mustn't. Too much caffeine will interfere with my sleep.,4595
Noshiro,This feels just like tutoring the little destroyers. Hehe~,4595
Noshiro,Hm? Oh my apologies. I didn't realize you were calling for me.,4596
Noshiro,Why don't we focus on work for now?,4596
Noshiro,What's the matter?,4597
Noshiro,Welcom?! What are you doing here? Wait don't leave—I was just surprised that's all Well what would you like to order?,4597
Noshiro,"Did you want me to call you ""Master?"" Understood Master.",4598
Noshiro,If you're lost on what to order how about I surprise you?,4598
Noshiro,I guess pigtails really do make you look considerably younger I hate to admit it but it's just like Agano said.,4599
Noshiro,Personally prepared meals aren't part of the service provided by the café so I leave the cooking to the manjuus but if you insist I wouldn't mind doing it for you.,4599
Noshiro,Please take your time.,4600
Noshiro,R-reflect on your conduct!,4600
Noshiro,Welcome back. Sometimes I don't really get how I should be treating you while in this outfit Oh it's the same for you? That's a relief.,4601
Noshiro,"Ahem. ""How's your order Master?"" Too emotionless? Then how about ""How's your order Master~""? Hey! Are you taking me for a fool?!",4601
Noshiro,Take that! Heehee Ahaha! Phew I know you don't like admitting defeat but I got you pretty good there. I might have tried a bit too hard but I'm pretty sure you were the one who told me to give it my all.,4602
Noshiro,You should enjoy yourself at the beach just like you ordered me to. Hehe.,4602
Noshiro,I like being able to unwind and have some fun in my swimsuit but long strolls along the beach are nice too. Um if you don't mind Maybe next time the two of us could,4603
Noshiro,If you're stuck trying to think about what fun things to do next why don't you ask the others? I'm sure they'd love to join you for anything you'd like.,4603
Noshiro,Sakawa I have an inkling of where she might be. Wouldn't surprise me if she's at a beachside hut somewhere stuffing her face with sweets. Sigh,4604
Noshiro,I picked this swimsuit because you told me we were going to play on the beach but instead No never mind. But did you perhaps want to see me in something more risqué?,4604
Noshiro,Want another go?,4605
Noshiro,Wh-where are you touching *blushes*,4605
Noshiro,Welcome back. Care for refreshments? Heehee make sure to finish the soda before it goes flat.,4606
Noshiro,I've received word that the commission team has returned. Why don't you take a quick break from work and go welcome them back?,4606
Noshiro,When it's time to fight my mind is solely on the battle. Playtime's over; it's time to focus.,4607
Nowaki,Zzz Fiiine I'll get up in a second The sun is so warm Zzz,4607
Nowaki,I like this place I don't need to hurt any of my allies here,4608
Nowaki,Arashi Yukikaze We're all together again in my dreams,4608
Nowaki,A-a mission? I hope it won't be difficult,4609
Nowaki,Your rewards won't disappear even if you don't collect them I think,4609
Nowaki,I don't really need a bedtime story,4610
Nowaki,Someone's come back Is it lunchtime now?,4610
Nowaki,Zzz Huh? It's over already?,4611
Nowaki,I can't fall asleep now!,4611
Nowaki,Hm? I'M the MVP?! What a lucky day!,4612
Nowaki,Where am I? Who's shooting at me?,4612
Nowaki,W-what's going on?!,4613
Nowaki,I can't sleep with you next to me,4613
Nowaki,Movies? They aren't really my thing,4614
Nowaki,Maikaze I promise I'll help you this time!,4614
Nowaki,I tried too hard to be brave in Leyte Gulf In the end I couldn't save anyone,4615
Nowaki,I made some chocolate for you too After Shigure and Yukikaze woke me up and we spent half a day making it So I'm really sleepy Good night Zzzzz,4615
Nowaki,Sadly my chocolate doesn't bring good luck How do I know? My own luck cancels it out I guess? I'm taking another nap now Zzzzz,4616
Nowaki,I made you this chocolate while I slept Are you worried about the quality? Just try it. It should be just fine. Happy Valentine's Day Zzzz,4616
Oite,You came of your own accord. How fortunate Never you mind. Get to work.,4617
Oite,How I wonder would one go about making Agano stop touching my ears,4617
Oite,I like the quiet of the office free from the jarring hum of propeller aircraft.,4618
Oite,Whuah! Would you STOP tickling me?,4618
Oite,Whuah?! Wh-wh-wha-what has gotten into you fool?!,4619
Oite,What the–?! K-k-keep your hands off my ears!,4619
Oite,To think a trivial task would have you up-ended like this If you so insist it's impossible then I will set an example.,4620
Oite,Mission complete. Will you get a move on already and process the rewards?,4620
Oite,Correspondence has arrived. Don't come nagging later saying I didn't inform you.,4621
Oite,No unauthorized persons entered the office in your absence. End of report.,4621
Oite,The commission team has returned. I will see to the transport of the goods and you to its inspection.,4622
Oite,You have my gratitude.,4622
Oite,Enough talk! Have at you!,4623
Oite,All I did was perform my duty as I said I would.,4623
Oite,We must start anew at boot camp,4624
Oite,Let us finish this!,4624
Oite,When push comes to shove retaliate!,4625
Oite,I expect no betterment from you. Go on let your name be irreversibly tarnished.,4625
Oite,What do you need from me? Make it quick.,4626
Oite,"You need an attendant for your outing? Understoo– Wait why would you need an attendant for a tour of your own port? You want to ""hang out"" with me? What does that mean?",4626
Oite,"I cannot wrap my head around your need for an attendant when there are no hostiles at the port Nor do I grasp this ""hang out"" business! Although I did enjoy our friendly exchange! E-e-end of report!",4627
Oite,"All your talk of attendants and ""hanging out"" was just an attempt to seduce me was it not? N-no I mean nothing bad by it! Oh forget it! You toyed with my heart and now you must o-own up to it!",4627
Oite,I don't know what to do at this ceremony! You insisted on it so it's your responsibility to g-guide me through it! E-end of report,4628
Oite,"Valentine's Day""? Hmph. I have absolutely no interest in this outlandish holiday you describe. As for what I am making it is a type of edible charm traditionally made on this day. Kamikaze told me about it Wh-what?! You mean this is to partake in this ""Valentine's Day""?!",4628
Oite,Discretion is required to abolish even a pointless holiday. It's for that reason alone I've made you chocolate again. You say my chocolate-making skill has improved over last year? How can you remember how something so trifling tastes?! I've not even practiced in the slightest!,4629
Oite,Oh to hell with it! I will practice until I can effortlessly split this watermlon!,4629
Oite,I'm much obliged for the help Hatakaze! Now watch – I will cleave this watermelon in twain!,4630
Oite,Wh-what is it?,4630
Oite,What in the name of–?! What is the matter with you?!,4631
Oite,Whuah! What are you doing?!,4631
Oite,Truly Kamikaze? You're certain I will become proficient faster if I wear a blindfold?,4632
Oite,The essence of the plum tree is best captured with erratic brush strokes This is quite the elegant ink painting.,4632
Oite,"In the ninth year of Yonghe and the year of the Water Ox"" Bah! The rest of the text is unintelligible to me",4633
Oite,Writing a poem in seven steps? Is there a person on this earth capable of such a feat?,4633
Oite,Kamikaze what should one offer the young'uns as a new year's gift other than money?,4634
Oite,Eep! Y-y-you're doing this on purpose aren't you?!,4634
Oite,Eek?! Y-y-you reprobate! What's the matter with you?!,4635
Oite,Whuaah?! I've told you countless times! St-st-stop touching my ears!,4635
Oite,Should you think of any good ideas for verses tell me. I will write them down.,4636
Oklahoma,Huh? What are you looking at? Is there something on my face?,4636

Oklahoma,*Cries* I need to work even harder!,4640
Oklahoma,Fire~!,4641
Oklahoma,I wonder if my eyes are lying,4641
Oklahoma,I've already become more independent so my sister told me that I'll be able to take care of you now! Ehehe~,4642
Oklahoma,It was real hard work putting together this whole ensemble but well worth the effort. Maybe I can convince my sis to change into matching costumes next time~,4642
Oklahoma,I paid extra attention to all sorts of details from the feathers in my hat to the tassels on my clothes! I'm really glad you noticed them!,4643
Oklahoma,I actually made this little Manjuu eyepatch myself. If there are any doodads you want me to make for you just hit me up!,4643
Oklahoma,Alrighty let's put our best foot forward today as well!,4644
Oklahoma,Eep?! Wh-what's gotten into you?!,4644
Oklahoma,The two of us did some real good work today so I'm looking forward to all the praise I'll be getting from my sis! Ehehe~,4645
Omaha,Ahh I'm so hungry,4645

Omaha,Oh no! I loaded my guns with snacks instead!,4649
Omaha,Maybe I should lose some weight What isn't it normal to try and look good for the person you like? Besides it's not like I'm really fat or anything!,4650
Omaha,All right I'm leaving your Valentine's chocolate right here! I've gotta go and meet up with Concord and eat up all the extra chocolate we made! See ya!,4650
Omaha,This Valentine's I've got both premium storebought AND handmade chocolate for you! I'd say I've gotten pretty good at making it now. Let me tell you I had to REALLY fight the urge to eat it myself. I deserve a pat on the back for that Hm? Do I wanna eat it together with you? Heck yeah I do! Let's dig in!,4651
Omaha,I'm really proud of the chocolate I made this year! Oh and this one's my self-reward for my hard work You want to try that one too? B-but I waited in line just to buy it so of course I'm gonna share it with you!,4651
Oyashio,Kuro is my dear friend! Her namesake is obvious isn't it? My oh so serious big sister!,4652
Oyashio,Of course the strings are a puppetry thing. So why do I put torpedoes on them? Ahaha Let's call it an old trade secret.,4652
Oyashio,Oooh! I just came up with a new idea for a show!,4653
Oyashio,Come one come all!,4653
Oyashio,The fun has only just begun right~,4654
Oyashio,As a ninja my sister is always very serious And since I'm a puppeteer I always thought it would be nice to make her laugh sometimes. That's kind of a tall order though ahaha,4654
Pamiat_Merkuria,Secretary work eh Like I'm happy to work hard for you and all but wouldn't it make you even happier to work hard for me?,4655

Penelope,Would you like some of the rosehip tea that Aurora taught me to make? It's too sour? Hmm Maybe I accidentally added vinegar,4695
Penelope,A promise ring proof that you always want to stay with me? Mm But even without this as long as you think of me sometimes call for me and look at me that's all I need.,4696
Penelope,Here I made you some chocolate just like I was supposed to do. Oh I'm not saying that you told me to make these. It's just that everyone else was talking about making some that I felt like it'd be remiss for me not to,4696
Penelope,The next step is melting the chocolate right? All right. Rest assured I'll do exactly as you say What's wrong? I know this feels odd but I can't make chocolate you'd like without clear and precise instructions.,4697
Penelope,I made chocolate the same way as last year like everyone told me to. Huh? Not all Valentine's chocolate is the same? While there were some new ingredients I thought it was the same thing in the end,4697
Penelope,Paperwork paperwork Mm as you suggested I put somewhere prominent so I'll find it soon enough.,4698
Penelope,I will do anything you tell me to. It can be anything.,4698
Penelope,Aurora chose this outfit for me because the Spring Festival represents a time of celebration in the Dragon Empery and red is the color that best symbolizes that. What do you think? Does this outfit make you feel more festive?,4699
Penelope,Happy Lunar New Year. I'm glad I can see you today.,4699
Penelope,Aurora also gave me this incense burner. It's supposed to be good for recovering from fatigue so shall we give it a try together?,4700
Penelope,The broth in the hotpot was as red as my clothes It was a bit scary at first but the food ended up being really delicious.,4700
Penelope,The pattern on this fan was embroidered. I learned how to do it from Yat Sen and the others a while back but my hands were trembling so much I made a mess of things Ugh I wonder how everyone does this so well.,4701
Penelope,Galatea said that today's lucky colour is blue. Don't worry about it? Okay I won't then. I believe you.,4701
Penelope,Hm? Already tired? You can lie down here if you'd like.,4702
Penelope,Welcome welcome. I've been working here as a maid just as you told me to. Umm Call for me only when you're ready to order.,4702
Penelope,Did you call? Well what do you want? You still need some more time? Call for me when you've decided.,4703
Penelope,Here I brought you your order. It's still frozen? Of course? I never heated it up. Why? You never told me to?,4703
Penelope,Here's the menu. Call me if you need me.,4704
Penelope,No that's not it? What do you mean by that? There's no way for me to know unless you show me,4704
Penelope,Sure here's the pepper mill. How much do you want? Oops I spilled it all,4705

Pennsylvania,Is that the best you've got?,4713
Pennsylvania,You're such a coward,4713
Pennsylvania,You want to stand next to me? Think carefully now. That is a very hard thing to do.,4714
Pennsylvania,It's alright if you don't want to push yourself further. You've worked very hard. I thought you were joking but How do I say this I'm used to protecting others But to meet someone who cares about me really is something else.,4714
Pennsylvania,Mmm you've worked so hard. I didn't think that you'd be able to catch up with me You want a reward? How about a kiss? Or an unforgettable evening? Both are fine with me~!,4715
Pennsylvania,This fleet has turned into a place I can call home The people I want to protect and the person who protects me despite being unable to kill a bug and then the 'me' who becomes so giddy for that person are all here You idiot *blush*,4715
Pennsylvania,"When I say ""here's some chocolate from your big sis"" I don't mean that in a familial kind of way. You can take it that way too but as for me I consider this more along the lines of lovers' chocolate. Hehe~",4716
Pennsylvania,"When I gave my chocolate to you and you called me ""Sister Penn"" that was somehow really memorable Others call me that all the time but when you do it it's way different. My heart won't stop throbbing",4716

Prince_of_Wales,Although I don't really want in on the beachball game but it was a request from Hood.That sun-loving girl. Don't forget to cheer for me!,4826
Prince_of_Wales,Regardless of the time and situation to ignore a fair maiden is most ungentlemanly.,4826
Prince_of_Wales,Hood you should get some sun once in a while too you know.,4827
Prince_of_Wales,Do you need me to teach you how to properly treat girls?,4827
Prince_of_Wales,Fear not for dangers and obstacles leap over challenges and charge towards your goals. This is how unprecedented accomplishments are achieved!,4828
Prince_of_Wales,New mail? Hood stop staring at me. They aren't for me!,4828
Prince_of_Wales,I'll welcome the girls home from commission. Take a rest if you're really tired.,4829
Prince_of_Wales,I can't die happy until I see Prinz Eugen with a true and honest smile on her face.,4829
Prince_of_Wales,Love with you is like priceless treasure. I wouldn't trade even an entire kingdom for it!,4830
Prince_of_Wales,Learning about the customs of the other nations is quite interesting. I feel like I get along better with the Sakura girls now.,4830
Prince_of_Wales,"I miss my black tea a bit but I suppose ""when in Rome do as the Romans do."" I guess I should fully enjoy the culture of the Sakura Empire.",4831
Prince_of_Wales,Why are you staring at me? I'm suave? Hehe I suppose I should take that as a compliment.,4831
Prince_of_Wales,Oh you're back. Did you run into any of my sisters on the way here?,4832
Prince_of_Wales,The Manjuus drive these things Sure it's a mystery how they're able to turn the steering wheel but I'm more curious about how they're able to step on the accelerator,4832
Prince_of_Wales,Does something about this outfit bother you?,4833
Prince_of_Wales,Heh I won't let you go any further.,4833
Prince_of_Wales,Let's put on a performance to be remembered – for the sake of your victory.,4834
Princeton,You're finally here. Did you rest well?,4834
Princeton,Did you need something? Oh it's fine. I wasn't doing anything special just sorta letting my mind wander.,4835
Princeton,Sara? S-Saratoga is someone I admire very much. I wouldn't dare call her by her nickname.,4835
Princeton,Montpelier is a close friend of mine. It's not because we were both members of the Cleveland class but because we both have someone we really look up to in our lives.,4836
Princeton,Feel free to give me as much work as you need. It's part of a secretary ship's duties so don't fret it.,4836
Princeton,What do you think I'm too inexpressive? I was wondering if that's why it's like you're always trying to make me laugh.,4837
Princeton,Have you never tried a knuckle sandwich before? How about a taste of mine Hyah!,4837
Princeton,We've been assigned new missions? Let's give them a look.,4838
Princeton,Mission rewards My heart's dancing with glee.,4838
Princeton,Your mail? I'll go get it so just stay there and focus on your work.,4839
Princeton,You look pretty tired. Here's a towel.,4839
Princeton,Heading out to greet the commission team? I'll go with you.,4840
Princeton,Go forth No. Let's put the lessons we've learned into practice!,4840
Princeton,Looking good. Let's press on.,4841
Princeton,Still out of Saratoga's league,4841
Princeton,I won't let history repeat itself!,4842
Princeton,Honestly I'd rather have Saratoga be the one giving me directions.,4842
Princeton,You wanted to have a chat over some tea? Pl-please just a moment Umm I need to tidy up the room a bit so I'd appreciate it if you could give me half an hour or so,4843
Princeton,Ahem! So you were asking about my hobbies? I like to read books and study Saratoga's battle style. In terms of combat prowess I sincerely believe that Saratoga is in a class of her own and wouldn't lose even to Enterprise herself.,4843
Princeton,I'm so lackluster compared to Saratoga so why would you? Err not that I'm turning you down! If anything I'd be willing to go through thick and thin with you as long as you're fine with someone like me Yes let's be together!,4844
Princeton,(Special Valentine's Chocolate' from the candy store at Manjuu Land that you visited with Princeton. She seemed pretty lost inside the amusement park but the moment we entered the candy shop she had a dazzling smile on her.),4844
Princeton,(Classical music plays in a rented-out tea room as Princeton hands you a box labeled Special Valentine's Chocolate. This may in fact be the one day of the year when you get to see that faint smile on Princeton's face.),4845
Princeton,I'm so happy to see you again. Let's get stuff done!,4845
Princeton,Wow I can't believe Saratoga called me Princey Today must be my lucky day.,4846
Princeton,Montpelier's sister Cleveland is truly a fascinating person. There are plenty of things I can learn from her as well.,4846
Princeton,Feel free to entrust me with as much work as you need me to. After all we've both sworn to work hard to become like Saratoga no?,4847
Princeton,I don't mind you trying to get me to laugh but these pranks are a bit W-wait was this Saratoga's idea all along?!,4847
Princeton,Geez that was very naughty of you. *pat pat*,4848
Princeton,You look exhausted Hold still I'll wipe that sweat off your brow.,4848
Princeton,Have you done your stretches yet? You don't want to get cramps because you rushed into the ocean unprepared.,4849
Princeton,"I got this collector's edition of ""Saratoga: Beautiful Summer Days"" from Gridley. Looking at Saratoga enjoying the summer with everyone else makes me wish I could join her",4849
Princeton,Hehehe. With this I'll be able to improve my sense of balance and my physical strength at the same time. Would you like to give this a try as well?,4850
Princeton,You want to get on? I-it's not that I don't want you to but,4850
Princeton,W-wait a second! If you move too suddenly it'll capsize Wah?!,4851
Princeton,If you stay out while the sun's blazing you're going to get heatstroke. Make sure not to let the sun cook you for too long.,4851
Princeton,You're finally here? Ah well I only just got here as well so don't worry about it. Anyway shall we get going?,4852
Princeton,I heard there's a famous candy store around these parts. W-Why don't we stop by there first?,4852
Princeton,Saratoga told me this outfit looks fine on me but I wonder I really do look presentable in such cute clothing,4853
Princeton,A shooting game? Alright I'll show you how much I've improved thanks to Saratoga's special training sessions! Oh it's a bit embarrassing to get all pumped up by myself,4853
Princeton,You want to hold hands? W-Well that's not a bad idea Even though this isn't a big deal why is my heart pounding so furiously,4854
Princeton,Y-You did that on purpose didn't you?!,4854
Princeton,Of course I've prepared a present for Saratoga I do so every year. Saratoga didn't seem all too pleased though What could be the issue?,4855
Princeton,I heard someone at the port accidentally tied herself up while making some ribbons. I have to learn from those mistakes.,4855
Princeton,You want me to tell some Santa stories to the destroyer girls I did promise Saratoga I would help her out but I'm not much of a storyteller,4856
Princeton,If you love my smile so much I-I suppose I could smile a bit longer for you.,4856
Princeton,H-hold up! The ribbon's going to come loose–!,4857
Princeton,Check the mailbox? I'll do that when I go send out the presents.,4857
Prinz_Adalbert,This hourglass is real neat. Let's reset it and watch the sand go again. And again Welp that got old fast. Now 'scuse me while I go rummage through your desk for other cool gadgets.,4858
Prinz_Adalbert,Sheesh that's a crazy amount of paperwork on your desk. Wait can't we just feed 'em to the shredder and be done with it? No? Fine I won't do it then.,4858
Prinz_Adalbert,Don't you ever feel fed up doing the same task for hours at a time? I'd give up after like thirty minutes.,4859
Prinz_Adalbert,"You know how Heinrich nicknamed her rigging ""Eisen""? I'm thinking about naming mine too.",4859
Prinz_Adalbert,Huh? I don't recall doing anything to earn a headpat but okay.,4860
Prinz_Adalbert,The mission list grows ever longer I say we just put it through the paper shredder honestly.,4860
Prinz_Adalbert,Yo your mailbox is full. Want me to empty it for you?,4861

Prinz_Adalbert,My comeback is-a coming in round two!,4864
Prinz_Adalbert,You're such a lame-ass I'm gonna go hang with someone else.,4864
Prinz_Adalbert,Let's start by checking out the depot. There's bound to be peeps there who need a hand or just wanna hang out.,4865
Prinz_Adalbert,Seeing other people happy makes me happy too~ That's why I love both helping people and hanging out with 'em equally. Other girls have said we're the same in that regard you and I. You just love seeing people happy too right?,4865
Prinz_Adalbert,Sooo how 'bout say we look around for people in need of a helping hand? There ain't no problem we can't solve together. And if nobody needs help we can just hang out instead.,4866
Prinz_Adalbert,Does this mean we're like super duper besties? Even more than that? Huh Super duper ultra mega besties then? Let's go with that and promise each other we'll always be together~,4866
Prinz_Adalbert,Howdy. Finished charging your batteries? I can help if you still need more energy.,4867

Prinz_Adalbert,I'm like a human shredder tearing paperwork you don't wanna do into ribbons Hmm. You sure you can still manage with this amount?,4868
Prinz_Adalbert,It's not so bad doing the same task all day when you've got someone to vibe with~,4869
Prinz_Adalbert,Heard Strasser sat Heinrich down and made her read a book for once. Maybe I should find something to read before bedtime.,4869
Prinz_Adalbert,You've really got a uh keen interest in women's bodies.,4870
Prinz_Adalbert,I'm gonna open the window and get some fresh air in here. C'mon! Breathe in breathe out!,4870
Prinz_Adalbert,You down to hang out with me today? Ah right you've got work Tell you what I'll help you with it. First order of business: putting a smile on your face~,4871
Prinz_Adalbert,How'd I end up here lying down on the counter? Think I closed up shop then got all sleepy *yawn* Truth be told I'm still pretty sleepy.,4871
Prinz_Adalbert,Taking orders moving dishes and cleaning tables that's this job in a nutshell. Never gets boring as long as you do 'em in rotation!,4872
Prinz_Adalbert,Honestly not a fan of the liquor menu. All the drinks on there make my head spin,4872
Prinz_Adalbert,Earlier today I was caught gawking at my coworkers while they were mixing drinks. I was so distracted that Bismarck herself called me out for it.,4873
Prinz_Adalbert,I'm no marionette ya hear!,4873
Prinz_Adalbert,This stuff won't fly during open hours ya hear?,4874

Prinz_Eugen,Ich liebe dich~ is this a joke or the truth? Why don't you decide for yourself~,4885
Prinz_Eugen,Why do you feel a warm tingling feeling inside you ask? Well I wonder? What I gave you were Valentine's chocolates. Isn't it obvious that the feelings of the person who made them would be conveyed by them? Feelings such as passion gentleness and slightly melted love Hehe~,4886
Prinz_Eugen,Here are some Valentine's chocolates for you. But you know what I really wanted to have you taste savor the flavor and devour wasMy~ what might you be imagining? I haven't said anything yet you know? Hehehe,4886
Prinz_Eugen,Prepare for the tastiest Valentine's present you'll ever get – me. Heheh you should see the dumbfounded look on your face. Guess what? I know exactly what you're thinking right now. You're fantasizing about what will come later today. Heheheh,4887
Prinz_Eugen,Where's the surprise in getting sweet chocolate every single Valentine's? Let's have some drinks instead. I asked the local Iron Blood brewery to make chocolate-flavored beer just for the occasion. Sad you don't get regular chocolate? I'll make it up to you – after we've had a few. Heehee,4887
Prinz_Eugen,If fate brought us together then it has my thanks I look forward to our future together~,4888
Prinz_Eugen,Don’t overstretch yourself at work ~ otherwise my loneliness will drive me to tease you.,4888
Prinz_Eugen,I feel so lucky right now --- why you ask? Take--a--guess dear?,4889
Prinz_Eugen,Relaxing on a float gently licking my lips is this really the most popular photo pose for the beach? Wales you’re not teasing me again are you?,4889
Prinz_Eugen,Woah! I got a pretty dark tan after playing with Wales all day,4890
Prinz_Eugen,Wales someone is going to break your hand again if you keep messing with Bismarck! I won't plead for you this time,4890
Prinz_Eugen,Despite her devil-may-care attitude Wales is actually quite reliable. In fact she helps me all the time even though we were once enemies,4891
Prinz_Eugen,I went and told Hipper about our beach day and all she said was 'Why do I need to be jealous about your thin lewd and non-combat-ready swimming suit?' Haha that's so like her!,4891
Prinz_Eugen,There are a lot of good things about Wales but please avoid picking up her bad habits.,4892
Prinz_Eugen,"Frohes neues Jahr~ This is how we say we say ""Happy New Year"" in the Iron Blood.",4892
Prinz_Eugen,The Sakura Empire's sake is truly delicious~ Next time why don't we ask those stingy girls to let us try some liquor from the Dragon Empery~,4893

Prinz_Eugen,New Year's greetings huh? Aren't you the popular one~,4894
Prinz_Eugen,So what do you like about me? My personality or my body? If you lie I'll make you take a shot~,4894
Prinz_Eugen,The Sakura Empire's liquors certainly have a distinctive flavor but when a girl wants to cut loose it's gotta be one of the classics~,4895
Prinz_Eugen,Pfft You're just too cute when you act all bashful but still can't resist trying to ogle me ahaha~!,4895
Prinz_Eugen,Come on don't be so tense. Just let go and relax.,4896

Prinz_Eugen,You know when we ran into Hipper the other day on our day out she started sulking and turned beet-red the moment she saw your face. I wonder why? Heehee.,4902
Prinz_Eugen,It's customary to pour wine into a wine glass but I'd like to try a different container. I wonder how I'd make a cocktail out of it.,4902
Prinz_Eugen,Hehehe don't be in such a hurry. The night has only just begun,4903

Prinz_Rupprecht,You belong to me which obviously means you have a duty to amuse me! Understood simpleton? You're to give me a full tour of the port's Spring Festival makeover! Hold my hand and show me around! That's your job!,4945
Quincy,Being stared at like this is really embarrassing,4946
Quincy,Um sorry I'm not really sure how to turn people down Besides isn't it good to make others happy?,4946
Quincy,I'll have you know that I've turned down plenty of requests before! For example uhh umm I can't think of any right now,4947
Quincy,The commission fleet is back. Should I help bring the supplies in? Okay leave it to me!,4947

Quincy,Is this the best I could do?,4949
Quincy,Why must we hurt each other,4950
Quincy,I-I'm just getting started!,4950
Quincy,Even if you're this kind of person I won't give up on trying to help you! Probably,4951
Quincy,Do you need me for something? I'm currently helping the others carry some supplies.,4951
Quincy,Hurting others is more painful than being hurt yourself Huh? Doesn't everyone feel that way?,4952
Quincy,Why do I like helping others so much? Well it's because we can only build a brighter future if we all work together.,4952
Quincy,Eh? You'd like me to always stay by your side? Um actually I want to rely on you and be relied upon. I want to understand what you're thinking and I want to be with you forever *Whimper* This is embarrassing,4953
Quincy,Unfortunately I had barely any time left to make you something after I got done helping Astoria with her packaging Vincennes with her recipe and Minneapolis with her chocolate I'm sorry. I hope you'll find this acceptable at least,4953
Quincy,You said you wanted to try my own Valentine's chocolate so I made some. Here you go! Did I help someone along the way? Of course I did. Which is the reason why I turned up so late I'm sorry.,4954
Quincy,I'll just stay here and help watch everyone's belongings. Uh I'm really not very good with exercise,4954
Quincy,It feels like everyone is staring at me when I wear a swimsuit It's so embarrassing,4955
Quincy,Beverages? Don't worry I came prepared.,4955
Quincy,Listening to the sounds of the sea really puts me at ease,4956
Quincy,Is is someone in trouble?,4956
Quincy,*Whimper* Could you please not do stuff like this in front of everyone?,4957
Quincy,Would you like to have some cold drinks? Be careful not to have too many at once or you might get a brain freeze~,4957
Raleigh,Make sure you ask me any questions if you're lost before we head out!,4958
Raleigh,For a beginner every bit of training is very important~!,4958

Raleigh,I'm not a kid okay!,4963
Raleigh,You want to know more about me? Hmm you may be the first person to treat me like an equal. I'm happy about that I suppose.,4964
Raleigh,To receive something so precious from a student I should be ashamed to call myself a professional mentor But you make me,4964
Raleigh,Happy Valentine's day! Miss Langley and I worked together and made this chocolate as a reward for you. I may not look like much but you'd be surprised if you knew what a knack I have for things housewives might do!,4965
Raleigh,Happy Valentine's Day! Your treat this year was made with a recipe I got from Miss Ranger though I put my own unique spin on it too. Ahem As a teacher I must usually be strict with my students. But on this day I will spoil you instead. Enjoy!,4965
Raleigh,Happy Valentine's Day! I researched a wide range of recipes this year and this chocolate is the result. Rest assured the taste has Miss Ranger's seal of approval. Once you've finished savoring it I'd like you to fill out a feedback form.,4966
Reno,Woooww. Hm? Oh was I bothering you? I was just basking in the amazing feeling of a sidekick watching her hero work up close~,4966
Reno,I'm doing good work? Oooh! My hero complimented me! Of course my face is gonna turn bright red!,4967
Reno,You think they're big too? They really get in the way,4967
Reno,The commission came back. You want to go out and see them?,4968
Reno,Just leave the planes to me!,4968
Reno,Yeah! The good guys always win!,4969

Reno,I am Reno！,4970
Reno,I could do this all day!,4970
Reno,They say you should never meet your heroes. Now I know why Sigh,4971
Reno,There was a time when I was training really hard to become a superhero But these huge things got in the way of my dreams the flat girls don't know how good they have it,4971
Reno,"They say ""with great power comes great responsibility"" but superheroes need some downtime too just like warships. Sometimes I just gotta be a regular girl and you're no different. Let's do something fun sometime.",4972
Reno,So like from now on I'm more than just your sidekick. I gotta learn how to be a partner to you too for the rest of your life I don't really know how to do that  so you'll just have to speak up and tell me what to do~,4972
Reno,Being able to give the person I admire so much my chocolate I'm overjoyed! Really I'm so glad I put in so much effort! (Reno burst out into tears of happiness),4973
Reno,There's no greater happiness than to get to give my chocolate to you – my hero – yet again! The memory of this incredible day will keep me motivated for the rest of the year!,4973
Reno,This really is a huge clash of all the biggest names from all the factions. It's one exciting match after another! I gotta cheer my hardest too. Eagle Union go get 'em!,4974
Reno,Craven was supposed to be cheer squad leader on account of she's older but she ended up asking me to do it I can't let her down. I gotta cheer hard!,4974
Reno,Ah it's half time. That means we better get out there and cheer! Everybody ready? Let's get their blood pumping!,4975
Reno,None of the other factions have serious cheerleaders like me or Craven. But I won't underestimate the ones they came up with either I can't let them beat me~,4975
Reno,Look at them out there on the field shining like superheroes as they fight for victory being a cheerleader sure is amazing!,4976
Reno,It was really hard to find a swimsuit that would fit my bust Luckily I was able to find this swimsuit at the last minute! It fits my chest perfectly but my poor hips are chafing Ow,4976
Reno,Looks like everyone's pumped up for the beach volleyball tournament! If only my weren't so big. They make it hard to move around,4977
Reno,Oh yeah. How dashing does My Hero look when swimming? Do you zoom by others while going at 100 miles per hour? Hehehe~,4977
Reno,If you compete in the tournament I'll cheer you on with all I've got! Go! Go! Come on! You can do it! M-Y-H-E-R-O!,4978
Reno,If it isn't coconut milk! Is it okay to accept such a precious gift? Hehe. I'm absolutely elated to receive a precious present from my hero!,4978
Reno,Woah?! I-If you touch it like that it's going to snap!!,4979
Reno,So I was telling everyone about Reno Bunnino and for whatever reason North Carolina was super keen to hear it Not like that's a bad thing. More friends is always good!,4979
Reno,This gauntlet I'm always wearing? Oh uh I've not made my Reno Bunnino tool belt just yet so I'm making do with this for now.,4980
Reno,If you're doing what I think you are Yeah sorry there aren't many clothes my size.,4980
Reno,"An unforeseen accident causes panic at the festival! That's when our plain-clothed superhero rises up to the task!"" That'd be such a fun scenario! Although obviously we'd all much prefer to have a peaceful holiday.",4981
Reno,Hehe check this out! Doesn't this outfit kinda make me look like one of the Dragon Empery's wandering recluses?,4981
Reno,Want me to show you my micro-firework again? Hehe I'd be right happy to,4982
Reno,Sorry Ayanami. All my gadgets can do is shoot these little sparks. They can't fire real fireworks lasers or anything like that.,4982
Reno,You wanna hold hands? Sure thing! Ah wait this one's still a bit hot! The other one!,4983
Reno,Whaaa?! You're not supposed to lift this flap!,4983
Renown,My propeller? Hood bumped into me one day and before I reacted I received this in apology.,4984
Renown,What? You think Renown is cute? Well on her behalf I give you my tha Wait what?!,4984
Renown,Please claim the mission rewards!,4985
Renown,If you have time please look over the mail.,4985
Renown,I will review this operation's performance and report back to you as soon as I can.,4986
Renown,Your will is the source of my power.,4986
Renown,Enemy fleet in sight! All ships fire at will!,4987
Renown,Enemy fleet eliminated. Mission complete.,4987
Renown,Renown! Full speed ahead!,4988
Renown,Speed is the best defense!,4988
Renown,Love letter? How does one love something like a letter? People love all sorts of things but that one I cannot understand.,4989
Renown," Why would you arrange candles in a heart on the beach? And then why did you cry when I said ""aren't you afraid of the fire being extinguished by the wind""?",4989
Renown,Don't worry I'm not that dense. Next time I will bring a cap and cover up the candles for you. Then you can tell me what is truly on your mind.,4990
Renown,"Repulse and I made our chocolate together and she found it necessary to lecture me on the ""focus"" of chocolate. She said that ""chocolate isn't about emphasising your knightly glory"" among other things. I'm afraid my sister still lacks what it takes to be a true knight That's not the case? How so?",4990
Repulse,Hey! Com~man~der~! Let's get some exercise~!,4991
Repulse,Huh? You think I'm impatient?,4991
Repulse,Huh? I thought you'd be into softer girls than me,4992
Repulse,Whoah! S-stop You're awful! I'm a girl you know!,4992
Repulse,Missions! Missions! More missions!,4993
Repulse,Yes! Our rewards are here!,4993
Repulse,Deliverygirl Repulse has arrived with your mail!,4994
Repulse,You can't rest right after reaching port! Go exercise more!,4994
Repulse,You've made me stay with you inside so as your punishment you'll have to accompany me to check up on the completed commissions. Let's go!,4995
Repulse,Vaporize anything that moves into ash!,4995
Repulse,Hooray! We won! Quick decisive victories are my favourite.,4996
Repulse,Ahh the enemy was so persistent that I'm starving now There's no way we could've won like this,4996
Repulse,It's kinda boring being here with you I'm heading out for a while!,4997
Repulse,Com~man~der! Gotcha! Hmm? I'm too close? Hey what's the problem with that~ Anyway come and play with me~!,4997
Repulse,Huh?! You're happy with me? I'm not as elegant as some other royal girls and I don't dress all that great But when it comes to my feelings for you I rank second to none!,4998
Repulse,"Once my sister sets her mind to something she'll pursue it relentlessly. There's no way I can beat that But that's not the only thing that matters to you is it? When it comes to ""love"" it's fine to ""lose"" a little bit right~?",4998
Repulse,I never did get the chance to make chocolate with my sister this year either But on another note I hear George is always working on banquets and the like. I'd love to someday throw a posh party in your honour and invite my sister and friends to it too. For now though I suppose you'll have to make to do with this chocolate!,4999
Repulse,"I don't mind making chocolate with my sis even though I did snap at her. I mean you've got to agree that it's weird to pour your ""knightly glory"" into your chocolate! She's as grateful to you as I am but it's like that's the only feeling she'll admit to",4999
Revenge,Good morning Your Excellency. Is there anything I can help out with today?,5000
Revenge,You're not looking all too great Is something on your mind? If there's something troubling you please feel free to open up to me. It's not good to bottle things up inside,5000
Revenge,Eek?! I apologize I didn't notice the papers on the table I'll get to them right away!,5001
Revenge,Not so long ago I accidentally bumped into a destroyer while hurrying along I'm glad that neither of us were hurt but,5001

Revenge,Did something urgent come up? Then put it over there Y-you just want to chat for a bit? I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions,5002

Revenge,Um excuse me,5003
Revenge,Is there a new mission? Please let me know any time if you would like my assistance.,5004
Revenge,Allow me to retrieve our rewards for the missions we've completed! Oh I need to check the list first?,5004

Revenge,The girls are back from their commissions. Shall we go greet them together Your Excellency?,5006
Revenge,Thank you very much. I'll make sure to live up to your expectations.,5006
Revenge,Everyone follow my lead!,5007
Revenge,Alright let's keep this up!,5007

Revenge,I won't back down Hah!,5008
Revenge,Please don't give in to despair! If you just reform yourself there will surely be a day when you are accepted by everyone!,5009
Revenge,U-umm Your Excellency regarding the time I bumped into you when we first met Are you truly alright? Should we get your body checked?,5009
Revenge,"Protecting the weak is the duty of us Royal Knights—Uhh I'm not saying that you're weak Your Excellency. Though when we're on the battlefield you're definitely on the side of ""having to be protected""",5010
Revenge,Your Excellency not only are you the most important person in this port but you are also the most important person in my life. That's why your safety is paramount to me—whether here or on the battlefield I'll make sure to protect you with all I've got.,5010
Revenge,*pant* *pant* I heard you needed something from me so I ran here as fast as I could Wait—this is a ring? N-no way I-I-I-I'm sorry! This is so sudden I don't know what to say B-but gladly! Of course!,5011
Revenge,E-excuse me Your Excellency! I'd like a minute with Oh no it's nothing particularly important just Sorry I need to settle down before I trip! I'm carrying important goods you see Here! It's your Valentine's chocolate!,5011
Revenge,Welcome back Your Excellency. Hehehe after seeing your face I can't help but feel like today's going to be a great day.,5012
Revenge,That battleship from the Northern Parliament is truly knowledgeable of the etiquettes of the Royal Navy. I am truly impressed.,5012
Revenge,If you're feeling tired how about taking a rest for a bit? I shall be protecting Your Excellency by your side so you need not worry.,5013
Revenge,So you want to chat? I-I apologize! You need something done immediately don't you?,5013
Revenge,Whew I brought the mail over Your Excellency.,5014
Revenge,I'm so relieved that you're alright Thank goodness I really wanted to be out there to make sure you were safe you know? Ehe,5014
Revenge,I bear no grudges against you but Let the battle begin!,5015
Revenge,I don't enjoy fighting but I'm doing this to protect those I care about!,5015
Revenge,Your Excellency I do not consider you to be weak—and as such I don't protect you as a member of the Royal Knights but as a woman who loves you. That is my simple wish that which makes me happiest O-of course I plan on protecting you as a subordinate as well,5016
Revenge,Welcome back Your Excellency. As you can see I'm currently in the middle of cleaning,5016
Revenge,The Royal Maids and the Royal Knights both work hard to protect our allies. Volunteering like this renews my sense of purpose.,5017
Revenge,Leave this to me Eek! Your Excellency I apologize It wasn't on purpose I swear!,5017
Revenge,Your Excellency I've learned how to brew proper black tea and make cookies from the Royal Maids I-if there's a chance in the future I'd like to,5018
Revenge,I I'm fine. Something like this is nothing a maid can't handle Especially for a Maid-Knight like me!,5018
Revenge,Fighting on the battlefield is so much easier than being a maid,5019
Revenge,I can't believe I failed again Waah,5019
Richelieu,Place your faith in me. Follow my lead. Offer up your prayers. Seek the Lord. Only then will the path of God be opened,5020
Richelieu,I believe that any obstacle can be overcome with fervent faith and untiring efforts.,5020
Richelieu,"Those round little creatures If I recall correctly Algérie told me they're called ""Meowfficers.",5021
Richelieu,Have I met the Royal Navy yet? Yes. I hope to deepen our bond so I'm bringing some wine to the next tea party.,5021
Richelieu,Please make use of my precious allies the Iris Templar Knights at your discretion. After all one of their missions is to fight for peace.,5022
Richelieu,The relationship between those from the Eagle Union and those from the Iris Libre is a bit Well I get the feeling that Jean Bart would get along with them just fine though.,5022
Richelieu,If nothing else your audacity is commendable.,5023
Richelieu,May Heaven confer upon you its blessings.,5023
Richelieu,Missions may be called a kind of trial. If you take them on with the proper attitude there is no need to worry.,5024
Richelieu,The reward for those who work hard is Heaven's grace. Let us accept it gratefully.,5024
Richelieu,Letters are blessings from other people.,5025
Richelieu,At times might is needed to guide others on the right path. I give you my thanks.,5025
Richelieu,All ships prepare for combat! For liberty and glory! Aux armes marchons!,5026
Richelieu,May the wandering souls drifting about the battlefield find eternal peace and salvation Amen,5026
Richelieu,Is this also a trial from Heaven?,5027
Richelieu,Accept your divine judgment!,5027
Richelieu,There is still hope!,5028
Richelieu,Those who refuse to stop marching shall face the path of ruin Make sure you keep that in mind.,5028
Richelieu,The one you are talking to was once despisingly called many things: the calamity that brought on war the fearsome Cardinal and the maniac possessed by religious fervor. I ask of you: when you look at me what do you see in me?,5029
Richelieu,You've come by again. Haven't you been getting too friendly with me? Just kidding. I'm truly grateful to have another person that I can chat casually with. I hope that you feel the same way too.,5029
Richelieu,The feeling of distance between people is an interesting thing indeed. A superior officer and their subordinate. The leader of a fleet and the highest post of the organization. A warship and Hehe. For the time being let's let the others continue misunderstanding our relationship okay?,5030
Richelieu,As the one who guides Iris Libre I cannot make an oath solely to you. However I vow to protect and support you for as long as I live. This I vow on the holy name of Iris,5030
Richelieu,I meet with Jean Bart every once in a while. We don't talk much and simply focus on whatever we're doing at the moment. Even so I feel like we understand each other very well. It's something to be happy about.,5031
Richelieu,The practice of faith is not an easy path to walk. Discipline is required for enlightenment and the path is sometimes accompanied by suffering and even self-sacrifice.,5031
Richelieu,Please do not forget. The warriors from Vichya are also Iris Libre's brethren.,5032
Richelieu,It's time for worship. Please wait here patiently.,5032
Richelieu,If you would like to touch me I would prefer it if you took a different approach.,5033
Richelieu,Welcome back. Thanks to you everyone's safe and sound. I'm truly grateful.,5033
Richelieu,Whether you or I care more for the other is inconsequential. I feel more than happy enough just feeling our close bond together like this. Thank you for always being by my side.,5034
Richelieu,Iris' teachings do not go as far as to forbid its followers from spreading their wings. Let us enjoy today with everyone to our heart's content. Consider this as yet another of Heaven's many blessings.,5034
Richelieu,Frozen treats are most effective against hot and humid weather like this Shall we ask Dunkerque to prepare some more next time?,5035
Richelieu,Jean Bart Perhaps it's better to spend some more time with her Sigh,5035
Richelieu,If you know what's good for you I wouldn't assume that a girl is defenseless just because she's in a swimsuit.,5036
Richelieu,We have a really good view from up here. I can even see a commission group starting to return out there.,5036
Richelieu,Believe atone and pray. Seek a new day that you may grasp hold of your happiness and the road to the light.,5037
Richelieu,What these fortunes tell may be your fate. Even so is it not mankind's strength to overcome fate?,5037
Richelieu,Shh. Lower your voice. I'm trying to get this one to warm up to Jean Bart.,5038
Richelieu,Béarn is it already time? Yes I made a promise earlier to visit the shrine with everyone else. How would you like to come with us?,5038
Richelieu,Is this a greeting for the New Year?,5039
Richelieu,So this is what the Sakura Empire's New Year's greeting cards look like How interesting. Hehehe.,5039
Richelieu,Please calm down and ponder what we should do. I'll be waiting right over here.,5040
Richelieu,It seems the commissions team made it back safely. This counts as good fortune doesn't it?,5040
Richelieu,Settle down. Let us pray together. If I listen to your prayers and you listen to mine you will come to understand that we are heading toward the same goal. Let us walk toward the light. You and I together,5041
Richmond,Lots of my sisters have survived through this war. Impressive right?,5041

Richmond,That's right I was talking about love!  And the things that follow! I've never met a suitable candidate at least until I met you~! When I accept this it'll mean you agree to be my partner as well right~?,5045
Richmond,Here you go – my handmade chocolate! The secret to starting trends is to always be ahead of the times! With that in mind I made sure to write down what I put in the chocolate this time. Wait Where'd I put my notes?!,5045

Rodney,There's no need to be polite when dealing with enemies.,5051
Rodney,Can I increase my firepower?,5051
Rodney,Even I'm a bit disappointed,5052
Rodney,Not respecting the chain of command can mean big trouble it has happened beforeOf course it's ok for us since we're so close~,5052
Rodney,I have paperwork practice and dinner to see to today. The more burdens I can take off your mind the happier it makes me~,5053
Rodney,Each minute you slack off is one less minute of the day we'll have together. Please try to stay focused for both our sakes.,5053
Rodney,I've read that physical intimacy deepens a relationship the more you do it~,5054
Rodney,Please let's put this on hold until we're alone all right?,5054
Rodney,That's why you shouldn't underestimate a Big 7!,5055
Rodney,Beach volleyball? But I finally got a chance to be intimate with youI'll PASS~,5055
Rodney,I'll love whatever gifts you give me!,5056
Rodney,How's that? The feeling of a bona-fide Big Sev,5056

Roon,Every time I see something beautiful get squashed on the battlefield I just Aahhh,5061
Roon,I want to do something to soothe your mind. But what should I do,5061
Roon,"What my hobby is? Perhaps something like ""granting sweet release""?",5062
Roon,Hm? Do you want a hug too? Okay~,5062
Roon,What might this next mission be? I'm getting a little excited.,5063
Roon,Let's give our all on the next mission too.,5063
Roon,It's not any bad news is it?,5064
Roon,I want to pummel some enemies too~ *Giggle* The more of them you sink the more you prove your worth after all~,5064
Roon,Those commission girls must work really hard Okay everyone line up~ I'm going to give each of you a hug~,5065
Roon,*Giggle* You saw me and now you're trying to flee? Do you really think you can flee from me?!,5065
Roon,Aww Did we fall prey to an ambush?,5066
Roon,Don'tlook down on me!!,5066
Roon,How I'm faring at the base? Perfectly fine. Although isn't it a little too peaceful here?,5067
Roon,It is our destiny to kill one another on the battlefield So wouldn't you say it's normal to revel in the killing just a little bit?,5067
Roon,*Giggle* I get more fulfillment from being with you than from killing enemies on the battlefield Is this the power of love? But then,5068
Roon,Such a delightful party with our wonderful friends in this peaceful harbor It's wonderful really But it's all so boring,5068
Roon,When you see something so perfect and beautiful don't you just feel the urge to crush it?,5069
Roon,You're just in time I needed to blow off a little steam!,5069
Roon,"Hehehe That was another lovely ""banquet.",5070
Roon,While I like vistas as much as the next person I'm awfully fed up with the port's scenery at this point. Battlefields differ in that regard Ahh I'll never tire of seeing them.,5070
Roon,Heehee~ Don't you worry I'm not going anywhere. Why would I when it's you who brought me here?,5071
Roon,Since we have access to a piano could you help me work on my singing? I'm starting to feel restless from sitting around for too long Heehee~,5071

Roon,"Ah so this is what you meant by ""a break."" It certainly is a cure for boredom and I am happy to have some alone time with you buuut (I know you're trying to keep me in check and you're going to pay for that♥)",5074
Royal_Fortune,Movies! Video games! Ah modern entertainment is bloody amazing! It's easier than ever to stave off boredom even while not out at sea!,5074
Royal_Fortune,Gambling simply boils down to a test of who's luckier. It's not about winners or losers – it's about scamming poor sods who aren't as lucky as they thought.,5075
Royal_Fortune,Even we pirates have our own code of conduct. How are you supposed to keep people in line without rules? Speaking of which what kind of rules do you have?,5075
Royal_Fortune,Hahaha tired of boring ol' paperwork and ready for an adventure? I'm always ready to sail with ya,5076

Royal_Fortune,Let's find out who fortune favours!,5082
Royal_Fortune,Ugghh. If this were the olden days I would've fed you to the sharks or dumped you off on a deserted island.,5083
Royal_Fortune,Living in the moment means doing what you enjoy and forgetting all your troubles and concerns! That still doesn't mean I have the right to plunder? Laaame!,5083
Royal_Fortune,Even to this day lots of people go wild for pirate treasure! I suppose very few can resist the alluring shimmer of gold and silver eh Hm? Where do ya find said treasure? Sorry no hints! If you want treasure you gotta find it yourself~,5084
Royal_Fortune,Since you don't have a destination in mind why don't I plot your course for you? For instance to that deserted island said to have buried pirate treasure I've heard about. Heheh don't you worry – worst case scenario we only end up stranded and have to live there right? C'mon let's go!,5084
Royal_Fortune,Sooo you're sure about this? Living with me's not gonna be easy. You can't just change your mind later ya hear? Well alright then take my hand and put the ring on. Once we're done get on my ship and hoist sails!,5085

Royal_Fortune,Look who's back! Let's team up and get this paperwork done lightning-quick!,5086
Royal_Fortune,Port law article four! Be good and switch off the light before going to bed! Which means no worky-work either! Nighttime means leisure time!,5086
Royal_Fortune,While I do hate gambling I'm not opposed to making bets. On that note I bet I can win your heart with just one single date! Wanna find out?,5087
Royal_Fortune,Booze? God no! Just taking a whiff of that stuff makes my head spin and drinking it leaves me out cold until morning In other words keep it away from me.,5087
Royal_Fortune,If you're on board with it we can make up some quick excuse and get out of here right now Come on you still don't have the courage?,5088
Royal_Fortune,L-look even I shy away from some stuff,5088
Royal_Fortune,Mission complete! When it comes to my cut I don't need material stuff just some break time to smell the roses!,5089
Royal_Fortune,Here's a letter for you! And no it's not a wanted list. But if you did become an outlaw you can always flee to some barren corner of the earth.,5089
Royal_Fortune,Those who do the most work get the biggest cut!,5090
Royal_Fortune,Tonight's dessert is not a cake or a pastry What are you looking around for? YOU'RE my dessert! Heheh scared you didn't I?,5090

Royal_Fortune,Would be cool if we lived in a world where monsters are real! I get pumped just imagining what it'd be like!,5092
Royal_Fortune,You're in too deep to pull out now~,5092
Royal_Fortune,Wh-wh-whaddya think you're doing?!,5093
Royal_Fortune,Who did this?! Who put liquor fondue on my desserts?! Urgh It's hitting me hard I'm gonna go lie down a bit,5093
Royal_Oak,Hyah! Sorry I wasn't standing behind the door on purpose Umm I'm okay okay? You don't have to worry or apologize,5094
Royal_Oak,I was watching the girls perform a training exercise and a stray training round hit me N-no I'm not injured but It really hurt,5094
Royal_Oak,I at least have to see these documents delivered Yes I'll do my best to be back as soon as possible!,5095
Royal_Oak,Ack! D-don't touch me out of nowhere or you'll scare me,5095
Royal_Oak,Ah There it is! Who in the world folded the mail into a paper airplane?,5096
Royal_Oak,The commission team is back. Would you mind if I went with you to greet them? I'm a bit of a slow walker but,5096
Royal_Oak,P-please don't charge ahead so fast,5097
Royal_Oak,Phew. I managed to do my job right?,5097
Royal_Oak,Why is this happening? I tried so hard,5098
Royal_Oak,Don't hate me for this!,5098
Royal_Oak,Why does this keep happening to me?,5099
Royal_Oak,I think my speed should be enough for patrol work from now on. Okay I hope this next one goes safely Please please don't let me run into any submarines!,5099
Royal_Oak,Not only did you not abandon me but you've been considerate and even given me confidence in myself S-say! If it's alright with you could you teach me about more than just fighting and working?,5100
Royal_Oak,Revenge w-wait! Geez She left before I could tell her where those papers were going. What do I do now?,5100
Royal_Oak,D-d-do you need something? I'll do everything in my power to tackle whatever problem needs solving!,5101
Royal_Oak,I'll do my best to keep up with everyone!,5101
Royal_Oak,I-I can fight if I put my mind to it!,5102
Royal_Oak,P.E. is a nightmare. I don't want to drag my friends down in the relay race and I don't want random baseballs hitting me I wish there was some way to skip it.,5102
Royal_Oak,I'm not the worst at classroom learning. If there's anything you don't understand I-I could help?,5103
Royal_Oak,If you want to pass the time how about reading? For some reason there are lots of confiscated novels and manga here,5103
Royal_Oak,By the way how does Her Majesty normally spend time at school? Huh? She's actually bad at P.E. just like me?,5104
Royal_Oak,The others might realize something's up if we go back now,5104
Royal_Oak,I-if a hall monitor sees this everyone will know!,5105
Ryuuhou,You have kept me waiting No it's nothing. I can deal with this.,5105
Ryuuhou,I learned the power of submarines firsthand in that great war. While it's too late to turn back now I can't help but wonder how I would be perceived if I hadn't been remodeled into an aircraft carrier.,5106
Ryuuhou,Looking after submarines is really rough Th-This is from personal experience so please believe me!,5106
Ryuuhou,It's in my personality to not care what humans may think about me. This is the attitude that us warships ought to have as warriors.,5107
Ryuuhou,From time to time I become envious of the standard carriers If only I could be as strong as them,5107
Ryuuhou,Wicked thoughts begone!,5108
Ryuuhou,A new mission If it's a directive from the top brass let's take care of it right away.,5108
Ryuuhou,A letter has arrived. I'm curious about its contents Are you not?,5109
Ryuuhou,The commissions have been completed. I shall go ahead and greet them first. I hope their bounty is plentiful.,5109
Ryuuhou,I've been pent up for a while. You'd better believe I'm going to give you a piece of my mind!,5110
Ryuuhou,Unperturbed by both victory and defeat. This is my pride as a member of the Sakura Empire hehe!,5110
Ryuuhou,I-I shall let you win just this once!,5111
Ryuuhou,Victory is in my grasp!,5111
Ryuuhou,Ugh at a time like this!,5112
Ryuuhou,The sea of the Sakura Empire is nostalgic but I also have murky and mixed feelings about it No that's got nothing to do with me right now. Focus focus.,5112
Ryuuhou,I Ryuuhou vow to be at your side through thick and thin W-Well then from now on I will not hide any part of myself from you so prepare yourself okay?,5113
Ryuuhou,In order to learn how to make Western confections I spent time learning not only from my fellow Sakura Empire ships but also from ships from each and every camp in order to absorb their knowledge and make it mine. It was a lot of work but every time I thought of who it was for I was able to power through it. Please taste it for yourself—the fruit of my labors through the last year!,5113
Ryuuhou,I pledged to bring you victory so please sortie me more often! I I also want to attain victory for my own sake as well!,5114
Ryuuhou,Hurry up and finish the new missions. Otherwise people will say that I'm not carrying out my duties as secretary ship.,5114
Ryuuhou,Fantastic! We won!! What is it?! Am I not allowed to be proud of our accomplishments?,5115
Ryuuhou,I control my carrier-based planes with this charm A carrier cannot fight a foe face-to-face after all. This katana is merely a last resort.,5115
Ryuuhou,Because I'm in Shigure's debt I cook her some food from time to time. She's really a good girl even if she doesn't always act like one.,5116
Ryuuhou,W-What are you planning?,5116
Ryuuhou,You can leave the purification to me if Fusou and Yamashiro are both busy all right? After all I happen to be quite knowledgeable about that subject.,5117
Saint_Louis,If there are any disputes within our ranks allow me to handle the arbitration. That is my specialty.,5117
Saint_Louis,I fight so that there may be peace. That is the single role that I can play.,5118
Saint_Louis,While rewards may certainly be nice I have no interest in them.,5118
Saint_Louis,Suffering is the brand of a warrior. Everyone I'm proud of you for making it through.,5119
Saint_Louis,For the sake of the role that we all must play,5119
Saint_Louis,You shall all be purged equally!,5120
Saint_Louis,Ashes to ashes dust to dust,5120
Saint_Louis,My Lord why have you abandoned me,5121
Saint_Louis,God's love is boundless.,5121
Saint_Louis,This too is God's trial!,5122
Saint_Louis,My sisters in arms here may be righteous but not you. Prepare to face divine punishment sinner.,5122
Saint_Louis,I feel like I have earned the acceptance of the fleet. However is this truly the land that I was promised?  No I do not mean to cast doubt upon anyone. I merely feel that I may yet have a deeper purpose.,5123
Saint_Louis,Most of the time I participate in these events not as a participant but as a ship. I was considering doing the same for this Valentine's Day as well but I'd like to use this as a precious chance to express my respect and gratitude towards you. May you be blessed with the Iris's grace.,5123
Saint_Louis,Just as the Iris bestows her blessings upon all equally you give everyone an equal chance of delivering you chocolate. Mine is certainly nothing special. On this day I am but one of many though of course I would be glad should you find something notable about my gift,5124
Saint_Louis,I have no serious objections to sitting up here but there is one thing I cannot figure out. Are you perhaps deriving pleasure from seeing me up here like this?,5124
Saint_Louis,So I've managed to capture your gaze? Your eyes are Nevermind it doesn't bother me.,5125
Saint_Louis,My arbitration is needed? Very well please excuse me for a moment. I will make sure to hear them out.,5125
Saint_Louis,My weapon is always within reach. Should you will it I am ready to sortie at any time.,5126
Saint_Louis,As a servant of God there is no need for vanity— Having that said as the recipient of your love you are free to make any arrangements that please you. After all great and permissive is God's love.,5126
Saint_Louis,Let us also give our utmost this coming year as to not squander the preparations everyone has painstakingly made.,5127
Saint_Louis,The Dragon Empery's Spring Festival the celebration of a new year seems quintessential to all. Please rest well after completing your work.,5127
Saint_Louis,La Galissonnière seems to be thoroughly enjoying this holiday. Rather that girl seems to be able to find enjoyment in just about anything. Quite broad-minded of her.,5128
Saint_Louis,The greatest joy is to be able to have a life of peace. If everyone can act in accordance with God's will then there would be no need for justicars.,5128
Saint_Louis,Here are today's assignments. Let's work together to finish them quickly.,5129
Saint_Louis,God witnesses all your deeds. The trials you endure today will surely bear fruit in the future.,5129

Scharnhorst,You're back? Good timing. I'm just about to test my guns.,5219
Scharnhorst,Only those who have not been scarred would laugh at someone else's.,5219
Scharnhorst,Do me a favor and remind our friends not to sail directly in front of me I might not be able to resist firing at them,5220
Scharnhorst,Missions? Let's take care of them in one fell swoop.,5220
Scharnhorst,Rewards? Hah now that's what I'm looking forward to.,5221
Scharnhorst,Not bad at all. Seems like you're getting used to battle.,5221
Scharnhorst,A commission has been completed. Seriously you ought to let me and my little sister handle this stuff.,5222
Scharnhorst,I'm looking forward to the next battle!,5222
Scharnhorst,Let us trample the shattered remnants of our enemies!,5223
Scharnhorst,If there's anything worthy of my trust it's my cannon!,5223
Scharnhorst,I won't lose next time!,5224
Scharnhorst,Cowards have no right to stand on the battlefield!,5224
Scharnhorst,If only I didn't need to care about anything other than becoming stronger or defeating more enemies. But reality isn't so simple,5225
Scharnhorst,You've got a pretty nice fleet here. Being here makes me feel like giving it my all.,5225
Scharnhorst,Expressing your feelings with chocolate huh Though it's a strange custom I can understand the sentiment behind it. In any case I made some for you. No need to be shy.,5226
Scharnhorst,Here because I told you last year that I wouldn't mind making you some every year. Even though I was prepared don't expect anything from the taste. That said making chocolates is something completely out of my control,5226
Scharnhorst,Like I said last year I'm going to make chocolate the right way now. I'll think hard about the recipe and ingredients then trial and error my way forward. Hope you'll look forward to tasting it. Scratch that – I just hope you'll like it when you have your first bite.,5227
Scharnhorst,Haahh Guess it *is* true that sitting for too long makes you feel tired,5227
Scharnhorst,"Gneisenau ""convinced"" me to wear this dress and do ""something unrelated to fighting for once."" She didn't really let me decline. That's the long and short of it.",5228
Scharnhorst,Firecrackers? If you need something flashy and loud why not do it with a cannon salute instead of those toys? It's more impressive to boot.,5228
Scharnhorst,I'm really fond of the intense gaze my grimalkin has. Hahah relax she's a good girl. Just don't get on her bad side.,5229
Scharnhorst,The Royal Maids are helping out with the cooking? Hmph that head maid sure has a finger in every pie.,5229
Scharnhorst,If a *snowball* fight is all we're doing then I'll pass.,5230
Scharnhorst,Well well guess you're raring to play with my grimalkin.,5230
Scharnhorst,Looks like you're busy as ever even during the holidays.,5231
Scharnhorst,Just so happens I'm bored. You maggots are gonna fix that!,5231
Scharnhorst,Whenever I stop and think about what I can *do* besides charging into battle it makes me feel just slightly uneasy But I believe I'll find the answer someday as long as I'm with you.,5232
Scylla,Welcome home Master. I got everything ready for you so all you need to do is sit here and get right to work!,5232
Scylla,You know Master I think only the most outstanding maid should have the right to serve her Master What do you think?,5233
Scylla,Is there something you're looking for? I know where everything related to the Royal Maids' work is. Don't hesitate to ask.,5233
Scylla,I couldn't help but notice that another girl was cleaning your office Oh it's fine Master. But allow me to do it next time; I'm the maid taking care of you right now.,5234
Scylla,I'm happy to help with whatever you can't or don't want to do. There's nothing wrong with accepting your shortcomings and relying on your maid,5234
Scylla,Is something the matter? If there's anything I can do for you please don't hesitate to ask.,5235
Scylla,A maid must be willing to give her everything to her Master. Please do as you wish.,5235
Scylla,A reward for little old me? Heehee I'm delighted!,5236
Scylla,Do you have unfinished business? That's no good Allow me to help you Master,5236
Scylla,Another mission complete. Heehee I think your exploits are worthy of a medal.,5237
Scylla,Master you seem to be forgetting some mail addressed to you. Heehee you're so forgetful! But it's okay. I happened to bring it with me.,5237
Scylla,Don't worry about a thing. Everyone is safe at home in the port and I'm prepared to devote myself to you. So May I have my orders Master? Heehee!,5238
Scylla,A commission has been completed. Master I hope you aren't forgetting to welcome the team back? Good. I'm ready to depart any time.,5238
Scylla,Your favour is much appreciated Master.,5239
Scylla,Trust in your leadership and give the command!,5239
Scylla,Please accept my sincere congratulations Master.,5240
Scylla,So this is how you look when you've been beaten Heehee,5240
Scylla,Don't try to escape now.,5241
Scylla,Do not fret Master. I swear that I will return to your side.,5241
Scylla,Don't ever think that I might leave you Master. It is a maid's duty to care for her master even if said master happens to be a little wanting.,5242
Scylla,You are the Master and I am your personal maid. Why should there be any secrets between us? Heehee don't you hide a thing. You want to rely on me more and leave more to me don't you?,5242
Scylla,Have you finally found the determination to leave your everything to me? Heehee of course I accept. Leave it all to your personal maid Scylla while you drown in my love forever and ever!,5243
Scylla,Welcome home Master. Do you need me to tell you what must be done?,5243
Scylla,Is there something you need me to do for you again? Yes yes I'll do it. Just be patient. I suppose I'm the only person who knows that you can't do this Master?,5244
Scylla,Dido is a bit of a problem for me. She never loses things so she doesn't need me to find things for her. And since she's so capable she never needs my help.,5244
Scylla,Master if you have a lot of lost items why don't we do a big hunt for all of them? I promise I'll find them all. Heehee we won't need to trouble anyone else.,5245
Scylla,The more things you can't do yourself the more you'll rely on me and the more I'll get to manage you I'm pulling your leg. Is that really the sort of life you want Master?,5245
Scylla,Let me see your indulgent side Master,5246
Scylla,Leave everything to your maid Scylla my poor adorable Master,5246
Scylla,My Master. Should I really need to remind you to do such simple missions?,5247
Scylla,Well done Master~ Thanks to me you've managed to complete your missions.,5247
Scylla,Master you seem to be forgetting some mail addressed to you. Heehee don't worry. I'll remind you as many times as it takes.,5248
Scylla,Don't worry about a thing. Everyone is safe at home in the port. By the way Master Is it just me or do you worry about the others more than you do me?,5248
Scylla,The Master who brings us victory the Master who everyone praises and the Master only I know. Heehee,5249
Scylla,"Did you come all this way just because I asked you to Master? Or would you prefer I call you ""Senpai"" here? If we're at school then there's no reason for me to act maidly now is there? Heeheehee",5249
Scylla,"Welcome home Master. Rather ""Senpai""? Did you finally remember our little promise?",5250
Scylla,"I'm your maid Master so I'm glad to be used however you see fit. Or do you want to be ""used"" yourself Master? Heehee",5250
Scylla,"Senpai"" do you need my notes from last class? I wrote all the important points so it'll be just like you actually listened to the lecture!",5251
Scylla,Where has Lady Argus gone? Oh she's in remedial classes for failing grades? Goodness,5251
Scylla,We're just two good friends—in school anyway. But outside this campus Heehee shall we call that our little secret?,5252
Scylla,My Glasgow were you watching us? You were excited to see what Master's like at school too weren't you? Heehee don't worry. I'll get plenty of pictures for you.,5252
Scylla,"My eyes are up here ""Senpai""~",5253
Scylla,Is this the kind of stimulation you seek? Heehee you're so naughty~,5253
Scylla,"This shameful begging isn't like the ""Senpai"" everyone relies on now is it? But it's okay Leave this mission to me.",5254
Scylla,"It seems you've finished all of your missions ""Senpai."" Good job! You couldn't have done that with my help right? Heehee!",5254
Scylla,"Senpai"" your phone is ringing. Is that a call from someone? Such as another girl perhaps?",5255
Scylla,What brings you back here? Do you not have it in you to leave me alone? Or Is there something you want me to do for you?,5255
Scylla,"Senpai"" I'm about to show the other girls that look you had on your face. Are you sure you're ready for that? Heehee. Next time don't forget to greet the commission team upon their return.",5256
Scylla,"Well done ""Senpai."" Look everyone's cheering for you.",5256
Scylla,"There's no point trying to hide it ""Senpai."" You're just going to have to give up and Got you! I could never show another girl how pitiful you look right now. But of course If you would like the others to see I would gladly obey",5257

Sendai,I'm done warmin' up. Time to sortie or what?,5275
Sendai,These bandages? They're not for when I get hurt they're for wrapping around my fists You'll struggle to find anyone who can actually injure me.,5276
Sendai,I dream of justice justice for Never mind. Let's write off that one as a joke.,5276

Sendai,When's the next sortie? I've still got a ton of spare bandages.,5279
Sendai,Yo commission's done. Don't tell me you're really considering just keeping those hardworking girls waiting.,5279
Sendai,I'll become stronger then I'll!,5280
Sendai,You're going up against me!,5280

Sendai,I can't settle until I've made right out of wrong with my fists. That's my way of life. It's why I try not to get involved in anyone's business; I just don't wanna cause any trouble.,5283
Sendai,Feels like I've been here a long time I know I'm the one saying that but still it really has been a long time,5284
Sendai,People like you are pretty amazing. You do everything I want to but just a bit better When I'm with you I even lose track of time As long as you don't lose sight of who you are I'll follow you to ends of the earth.,5284
Sendai,Yeah I knew I don't got the dexterity to slice chocolate with gloves on instead of bandages. Don't sweat it I know you're just lookin' out for me not wanting me to get hurt. 'Sides this time 'round I made this chocolate with my sisters. I didn't do the slicing but that's fine – I still played a vital role.,5285
Sendai,At this time every year I'm reminded that there are some trials that can't be overcome with your fists alone. Actually If I knocked your lights out for a day wouldn't that do the trick? Hey I'm kidding! Don't get all pale! I made my own chocolate. It's not all that great so don't get your hopes up!,5285
Sendai,You're back huh? Focus on your work. Gimme a shout when it's time to sortie.,5286
Sendai,Yeah? Oh I'm working on my sortie pose. When goin' to war you need a war pose y'know?,5286
Sendai,Violence is the only solution I know of for my problems. That's why I envy you and Jintsuu sometimes.,5287
Sendai,Whenever I try to be like Jintsuu and use logic to solve problems I usually end up using my fists anyway. I dunno why either,5287
Sendai,Hardships don't get under my skin but I'm scared that I'll one day lose my way,5288
Sendai,Nice work. Want some sweets? You can have some of mine. They're all stuff I personally like though.,5288

Sendai,Where'd I put my bandages Oh right don't need 'em anymore Totally forgot.,5289
Sendai,Sorry to say but I can't afford to be defeated here!,5290
Sevastopol,Well met comrade. Would you like to learn more about my revolyutsiya? Heheh you hardly have to ask. I know you like the back of my hand comrade.,5290
Sevastopol,Carrier-based aircraft? Let me just say bring 'em on. We'll see if they can beat Sevastopol!,5291

Sevastopol,You have a new mission. Do your best and keep your eyes on the prize: a celebration full of vodka!,5293
Sevastopol,Ahahahaha! Another step closer to revolution! M-maybe I'd better tone down the drinking for today,5293
Sevastopol,In celebration of our comrades' victory A toast of vodka! Ack! *chokes* I-I'm fine!,5294
Sevastopol,Transport of goods especially to battlefields is a difficult thing. You should be thankful for the efforts of your commission team.,5294

Sevastopol,If you don't want to die stand aside!,5295
Sevastopol,Ahahaha! All who seek to obstruct the revolution are fated to fall!,5296

Sevastopol,Glory to the revolution!,5297
Sevastopol,Urgh! I'm not even drunk!,5297
Sevastopol,You certainly have the qualifications to be a proletariat but you don't quite understand the revolutionary spirit,5298
Sevastopol,I could trounce you with ease but as people with similar goals I will treat you as an equal. Heh you should be thankful that you've become an ally of the Northern Parliament instead of sinking beneath our iron billows.,5298
Sevastopol,I don't know what those battle-addled idiots think of you but if nothing else you might make for a fine drinking partner. Heh don't get too carried away; keep on applying yourself.,5299
Sevastopol,*hic* C'mon you haven't even finished half your glass yet. Pfft heheheh Waiting for me to drink myself under the table are you? Well too bad No matter how much I drink *hic* I'm not goin' down,5299
Sevastopol,I'd look miserable if I got drunk at work. Listen! You'd better stop me before I get drunk! Cheers!,5300
Sevastopol,Aww someone looks like they're ready to learn. Okay! Sevastopol dreadnought and training ship would be happy to teach you!,5300
Sevastopol,Ask me for anything. As a comrade I intend to do everything in my power to help you.,5301
Sevastopol,I brought some beer! Heh unlike Gangut you'd get bored of only drinking vodka pretty fast right?,5301
Sevastopol,Come to think of it when did I even put this on I-I mean gotta dress right for a hot spring bath right?! See? Look I even tied the sash right!,5302
Sevastopol,Voroshilov? Don't worry about her. I don't know if she gets by through grit alone but she's the kind to never get dizzy in a hot bath.,5302
Sevastopol,The joy of getting out of a hot bath? Umm How about you go first comrade? Erm I'm just feeling a little y'know,5303
Sevastopol,I'm soaked? Haha well yeah? I was bathing in the hot spring so duh?,5303

Seydlitz,"While I am overjoyed by your offer of marriage I'm worried if my answer won't be to your– No! Of course I'm not turning you down! What I mean is I don't know whether to say ""gladly"" or ""I love you."" You may decide if you'd like Commandant!",5317
Seydlitz,Commandant I'd like to give you my Valentine's chocolate! It's filled with the respect I hold for all you do. If you are even remotely satisfied with my service I could think of no higher honor than for you to have this!,5317
Seydlitz,As always I aim to please you today Commandant! I-if I inconvenience you in any way please do inform me.,5318
Seydlitz,Commandant you need not be concerned about me. I am being myself as one is obliged to be.,5318

Seydlitz,Commandant suppose I were to behave less like a soldier and more like a regular woman Would you prefer that?,5319
Seydlitz,You're very kind Commandant being willing to give ear to my opinions. Meanwhile I feel I don't even deserve to have opinions,5320
Seydlitz,I'll gladly listen if you wish to confide in me!,5320
Seydlitz,W-well if I'm your type then I suppose Pardon it's nothing Commandant!,5321
Seydlitz,Look you don't– Ahem. Commandant I'd rather you treated me as a soldier not as a lady!,5321
Seydlitz,Commandant! Please advise which mission I should start with!,5322
Seydlitz,I sensed you may be thirsty so I went ahead and made tea! W-would you like a cup?,5322
Seydlitz,Thank you for this high honor! This victory goes to my comrades and the Commandant!,5323
Seydlitz,Commandant! Miladies! Please make your escape while I hold the line!,5323
Seydlitz,"Good lord I should've prepared better before asking you on a date Oh no nothing's wrong! I-it's just Your immediate ""yes"" made my heart flutter in surprise Commandant!",5324
Seydlitz,There it is – Dracula's Castle brought into this world by chaos itself On my honor I swear I will put an end to the divine bloodline!,5324
Seydlitz,It's time to breach the castle Commandant. I shall lead the way!,5325
Seydlitz,Once the fighting ends so does the role of a vampire hunter Is that truly what I or rather the power within me wants?,5325
Seydlitz,I've got you now Lützow! Say your prayers for it's time you paid for the Commandant's lost productivity!,5326
Seydlitz,I'm more than just a shipgirl I'm now the blade that cuts down all evil. This duty granted unto me shall be carried out!,5326
Seydlitz,You'd like meat for dinner today? Certainly. The question is how do we procure meat out here,5327
Seydlitz,We know not what beasts lurk in the shadows Mgh,5327
Seydlitz,Such frightening armor Eek!,5328
Seydlitz,I have your new letter right here Commandant.,5328
Seydlitz,A castle of this size must have numerous ways in and out. Commandant we should take this route if you're in a hurry.,5329
Seydlitz,Die monsters! You don't belong in this world!,5329
Seydlitz,Salute! Oh dammit I dropped the bounty Apologies. I will clearly need to practice my posing,5330
Seydlitz,How do I look Commandant? I thought you may like seeing me in a dress however I don't know if this is what you desired or not,5330
Seydlitz,Let us begin Commandant. Your work for today has started.,5331
Seydlitz,My banquet attire pales in comparison to everyone else's If you could create my ideal look what would it be like Commandant?,5331
Seydlitz,On my name and pride I promise to find us a place to relax while you mingle with the other guests!,5332
Seydlitz,This way my fair ladies I'll be leaving your side momentarily to accustom myself to this place Commandant. Excuse me for a while.,5332
Seydlitz,A-at your service Commandant!,5333
Seydlitz,I feel I'm ill-suited to be your partner this evening Do you desire me regardless?,5333
Seydlitz,Exemplary work Commandant. Have you tried the food on offer this evening yet? I'm sure you're going to love it!,5334
Seydlitz,Victory can be seized even in a dress I'm now confident this is what you desired Commandant!,5334
Shangri-La,I strictly follow the principle of divulging nothing to outsiders but giving full disclosure to my superior officers.,5335
Shangri-La,Are you curious about these butterflies? Bugwatching is one of my hobbies actually. I brought these darlings with me from Panama.,5335
Shangri-La,Did you just perform a health examination on me?,5336
Shangri-La,My hair ornaments? They're a gift from Yat Sen; she said they go well with my name.,5336
Shangri-La,We've received a mission from headquarters. I made note of it in our task list.,5337
Shangri-La,You've received new mail. If you're short on time you could consider having me read it out for you.,5337
Shangri-La,The fleet has returned to port. Let us hold a tactical debriefing once everyone has had some time to rest.,5338
Shangri-La,A commission has been completed. Shall go and we receive the returning team?,5338
Shangri-La,Thank you. I will repay your generosity with greater glory in battle.,5339
Shangri-La,Turn bow to the wind! We shall teach them the importance of freedom!,5339
Shangri-La,Shangri-La will forever be out of reach to the likes of you.,5340
Shangri-La,This wasn't supposed to happen!,5340
Shangri-La,Weather the storm and fight with all your might!,5341
Shangri-La,Put out the fire! Please hurry!,5341
Shangri-La,*sigh* I've asked you time and time again to be more health-conscious Please have this cup of saffron tea. It's good for you.,5342
Shangri-La,Did you know that the saffron flower symbolizes joy in floriography? To me writing your biography fighting by your side and personally looking after you That is the greatest joy of my life.,5342
Shangri-La,This shawl you gave me is really cozy. Hehe let's huddle up like this There now we share the warmth.,5343
Shangri-La,This specimen looks to be fairly ancient You could watch from behind me or you could join me for an up-close examination; we can enjoy our time here however you wish.,5343
Shangri-La,It seems I can only make notes and sketches as there's no photography allowed here I'm a little annoyed by that.,5344
Shangri-La,"Should I respond like a dinosaur and go ""Graaawr!"" for you? Hehehe~",5344
Sheffield,Please mind your step Master Right there is where I just mopped.,5345
Sheffield,"Hmm? ""Cleaning"" things up with a gun falls perfectly within a maid's normal line of duty Master.",5345
Sheffield,"Master I love you."" Please believe me I put at least 30% emotion into those words.",5346
Sheffield,Master if you wish to take a nap please tell me ahead of time. I will make sure you don't oversleep with this gun.,5346
Sheffield,Belfast dotes on you too much Master. At this rate I'm afraid that you will turn into a useless lump of driftwood.,5347
Sheffield,Pest- I mean Master what requests do you have? I beg your pardon that was a slip of the tongue.,5347
Sheffield,I do hope you have this same kind of strong spirit on the battlefield.,5348
Sheffield,"Please entrust all ""cleaning"" tasks to me.",5348
Sheffield,Master do you plan to give all the mission rewards to me?,5349
Sheffield,Master I've already sorted your mail.,5349
Sheffield,Good work Master. There is still some work for you to take care of. Please do your best.,5350
Sheffield,Master does the sound of my gun not remind you of something? Perhaps something like the commission fleet that you've kept waiting?,5350
Sheffield,Hmm this feels a bit of all right. Thank you Master.,5351
Sheffield,"Garbage"" will pile up if you don't ""clean"" it up",5351
Sheffield,Are you satisfied with these results Master?,5352
Sheffield,Master please assign me to the rear,5352
Sheffield,Do you hear that? The ringing of your death knell.,5353
Sheffield,So you pests have a few tricks up your sleeves,5353
Sheffield,I see Master you are remarkably similar to a pest morphologically. The world is full of mysteries.,5354
Sheffield,I understand Master. You've finally awakened to the realisation that you are an oversized lump of non-combustible rubbish and your psyche is screaming for me to grant you the sweet release of Just kidding please wait while I make tea for you.,5354
Sheffield,To facilitate ease of reading I took the liberty of organising and re-categorising all the books on your shelf. Please check the results.,5355
Sheffield,Master are you troubled by the way I talk and act toward you? If so you must understand that is the way I express my love my beloved Master. Yes it's true.,5355
Sheffield,Upon the name of Virgin Mary I pledge may the hammer of love be dropped upon those that would harm my master Master? U-um I wasn't doing anything in particular. You must have heard me wrong. Anyway let's get this absolutely mortifying ceremony over with as soon as possible,5356
Sheffield,Sigh if it's chocolate you want just come out and say it. Don't play coy. I shan't refuse a request from my master Here do be quick in returning the favor.,5356
Sheffield,Here is some Valentine's Day chocolate for my wonderful Master What are you doing? Even the lowliest of pests would not hesitate to receive chocolate from a maid. Please consider the fact that this is extremely embarrassing for me too.,5357
Sheffield,This Valentine's Day chocolate is for you my most beloved Master. Please take it I know I remarked on your hesitance last year but it bothers me just as much when you accept it with no sign of reserve. Why? Because it catches me by surprise making me seem like a fool Pardon? You don't think so at all? I see.,5357
Sheffield,Pes– Ahem Master do you honestly think I've made chocolate for you? No I'm simply pretending to be as harsh as I once was as much as it pains me to do so. Yes my heart aches terribly so allow me to start over. Master you are the kindest soul I have ever met. Please accept my chocolate.,5358
Sheffield, Did you find out about my undercover identity? You leave me no choice. Master I cannot allow you to leave this room Of course I'm jesting it's merely a hobby.,5358
Sheffield,Master what kinds of missions are we to carry out tonight?,5359
Sheffield,Maid by day and secret agent by night? Hmm that does fit the Royal style. Unfortunately for you it's just your imagination.,5359
Sheffield,The slumbering city silent and dark inexplicably makes me feel at ease,5360
Sheffield,Master it is not incomprehensible that you would desire some excitement in your life but please focus on the work at hand.,5360
Sheffield,Do not let your guard down for even a second and always be ready to fight. From this point a secret agent and a maid are quite similar. Huh? Maids don't have to fight? Master your jests are quite rich.,5361
Sheffield,Master you don't have to come all the way up to get me. It's going to be a pain to get you back down safely.,5361
Sheffield,Out of respect for your bravery I shall reserve this special bullet just for you.,5362
Sheffield,Master what do you plan to exchange for this all-important piece of mail?,5362
Sheffield,Let's hurry up and get this over with. The night wanes.,5363
Sheffield,The Sakura Empire's summer festivals they're quite noisy. It will be difficult to keep things clean with so many people around Despite that I'm still having a good time. Is there a problem?,5363
Sheffield,So this is where you were Master. I was afraid that you had gotten lost and almost mobilised the entire Maid Team. What exactly were you doing?,5364
Sheffield,Swiftsure don’t stay in your room while the festival is going on. Go out there and socialise with the others. Of course it's worth the effort,5364
Sheffield,So this is cotton candy Mmf.. It's very sweet Nn What are you waiting for?,5365
Sheffield,Master what do you think about this festival? If you're enjoying it perhaps we can go to a similar Western-style event next time.,5365
Sheffield,Southampton why did you run off to the festival when you're supposed to be on duty? Ugh What am I going to do with you,5366
Sheffield,This outfit is quite breezy. I will have to thank Ms. Victorious on behalf of the Maid Team.,5366
Sheffield,I keep a gun with me at all times.,5367
Sheffield,Do you need something?,5367
Sheffield,Not a bad selection of fireworks. I thought that I had nothing to see since I've had to put on so many opulent displays of pyrotechnics for Her Majesty's enjoyment but I feel like these are pretty tasteful.,5368
Sheffield,Regardless of the occasion there is always time to take out the trash.,5368
Sheffield,The fact that you're asking your own maid to be your partner at the ball shows a concerning lack of gumption as a human being However if you go and make a fool of yourself it will reflect poorly upon my standing as a maid. Therefore I have no choice but to accompany you.,5369
Sheffield,There is no need for panic Master. I've become quite accustomed to your lack of punctuality.,5369
Sheffield,Don't worry I've hidden my gun. If anything happens I will protect you.,5370
Sheffield,Making your maid be your partner is a difficult request that falls outside normal lines of business. As fair compensation please bring me a cake later.,5370
Sheffield,As your partner I will naturally draw plenty of unwanted attention. I must steel myself mentally.,5371
Sheffield,I can see other members of the Maid Team going about their business What a strange fetish you have Master to make someone who should be working behind the scenes take center stage,5371
Sheffield,You'd like to escort me? Normally I'd decline because that'd be embarrassing but you'd look so wretched that I simply have no choice but to accept.,5372
Sheffield,Master please do not get carried away in your excitement.,5372
Sheffield,Master I do hope you haven't forgotten that there is still a party to attend How hopeless you are. Allow me to tidy up your appearance.,5373
Sheffield,Your enthusiasm for this party is understandable but please do not forget about the commissions.,5373
Sheffield,Allow me to warn you ahead of time Master. I will not come to your rescue if you spring another trap so please mind your step henceforth Just kidding. It is a maid's duty to aid her master after all.,5374
Sheffield,It is good to see you Master. Please let me know when you've chosen an infiltration route.,5374
Sheffield,Why am I braving this dungeon with you you ask? Well I don't believe any other party would take it on with a master less capable than a mere maid.,5375
Sheffield,Have you truly had ample rest Master? Considering your stamina I sincerely cannot fathom a scenario wherein we reach the end of this dungeon together.,5375
Sheffield,"*sigh* As much as I wish I could use my firearms to ""take out the trash"" doing so would entail wreaking havoc on the stage dressing.",5376
Sheffield,To think we must crawl through ventilation shafts. How revolting Oh it's nothing. Please Master lead the way – I insist.,5376
Sheffield,Please allow me to protect you Master. You will make this more difficult for me if you suffer an injury.,5377
Sheffield,Is this how you would portray a monster?,5377
Sheffield,You have received a new quest Master. I pray it's nothing that will put you in danger.,5378
Sheffield,Your quest rewards have come in. Please put them to good use.,5378
Sheffield,You have received a letter. Now is the most opportune time to read it Master.,5379
Sheffield,Welcome back Master. It surprises me to see you on the frontlines. While it's true you're helpless in a battle your mere presence does inspire courage.,5379
Sheffield,The commission team has returned. May I suggest that you contact them?,5380
Sheffield,I shall defeat our foes in one fell swoop.,5380
Sheffield,It pleases me to know you can be of some use during these dark times as well Master.,5381
Sheffield,(As long as we're in this dungeon I have the Master all to myself. I would ordinarily be insubordinate to ask for this exclusivity but if the Master so desires it) Oh not at all. I have no desire to remain here for as long as possible.,5381
Shigure,It's so peaceful How about we play a game of luck?,5382
Shigure,The gods seem to really love me so hurry up and shower me with compliments,5382
Shigure,You don't look too good. How about a torpedo to cheer you up?,5383
Shigure,Stop touching me! Don't blame me if something blows up!,5383
Shigure,Huh? Work? Geez it's ALWAYS about work,5384
Shigure,*Tsk* If it weren't for the rewards then who'd bother with these jobs,5384
Shigure,I brought you your mail~ Now guess which hand I'm holding it with,5385
Shigure,*Laughs* Guess who's back~!,5385
Shigure,Hm? Guess it's time. Heheh I don't even need to actually head out for as long as I'm in the fleet bountiful rewards are guaranteed,5386
Shigure,Mhm making me stronger is a smart decision.,5386
Shigure,Let's give a warm welcome to our foolish enemies~!,5387
Shigure,That was a good fight considering how they suck,5387
Shigure,N Not bad You'd better remember this!,5388
Shigure,I am Shigure of Sasebo! Watch closely!,5388
Shigure,We're gonna lose? That can't be~!,5389
Shigure,I curse you with bad luck! You idiot!,5389
Shigure,You want good luck? It's not something you can just get.,5390
Shigure,Getting pranked by me is a lucky thing on its own you dunce Although I do like that about you.,5390
Shigure,Thank your lucky stars that you're getting Valentine's chocolate from me Shigure! Eating it will ward off bad luck so make sure to sing my praises while you savor it~,5391
Shigure,So what are we doing today? Trying your luck against mine? Very well~ Since you insist even though you know you're gonna lose dummy,5391
Shigure,What are you looking at? Well you big idiot?,5392
Shigure,Aren't my nails super cute? Hah hah hah! By the by I'm the one always painting Yuudachi's nails and making them look pretty! Now tell Shigure how awesome she is,5392
Shigure,Heheh~! Well well what do you think you're doing? Com-man-der?,5393
Shigure,Because the mighty Shigure is such a benevolent girl all I've done is report what you did. Hahaha! Time to see how long you can evade capture,5393
Shigure,What are you doing?! Don't lump me together with that dumb Yukikaze!,5394
Shigure,You're gonna see what the mighty Shigure's really made of!,5394
Shigure,You thought I wouldn't bite you just because you complimented my swimsuit? *Hiss*,5395
Shigure,Yamashiro gave me this little rose! If you thought I'd give it to you think again!,5395
Shigure,Don't touch my ears I'm ticklish there!,5396
Shigure,Oxygen torpedoes: prepare for simultaneous launch!,5396
Shigure,Yamashiro warned me not to pull any weird tricks and she's treating me like I don't know that already If anything she's the one we should worry about,5397
Shigure,What's with that spinning gaze of yours? I'm right over here!,5397
Shigure,What the hell Yuudachi! At least try to mind your table manners!,5398
Shigure,There'll be a raffle? Hmph this time I'll defeat that stupid Yukikaze!,5398
Shigure,H-hey! Don't you leave me hanging over here!,5399
Shigure,I guess I have to always be with you to make sure an idiot like you doesn't get lost Heheh this beneficiary of Lady Luck will never lose sight of you,5399
Shigure,With your chocolate out of the way now it's time to make chocolate for my sisters! And yes you're gonna help out with it!,5400
Shigure,My chocolate is so unique you can't replicate it just by watching me! So gaze in marvel at me all you want! Heheh,5400
Shigure,Now to give it a good stir then Ahh! My apron's come undone!,5401
Shigure,Yup! My chocolate has the benefit of negating bad luck! It's because I make it so rarely!,5401
Shigure,Well well! You want more don't you Com-man-der? ,5402
Shigure,A letter? Give it a look right this moment.,5402
Shigure,Watch and be stunned by my greatness!,5403
Shigure,Here's proof that I'm the real lucky ship!,5403
Shimakaze,Houshou's carrot cake is just divine! I hope to taste it again sometime.,5404
Shimakaze,My rigging calibration checks out. I'm fully prepared to sortie at your command!,5404
Shimakaze,My shoes? They're quite special. In fact these shoes are what allow me to go faster than everyone else! Ha-hah!,5405
Shimakaze,The Sakura Empire is home to many sword-wielding shipgirls If I ever get the chance I'd love to borrow and swing someone else's sword for myself.,5405
Shimakaze,Any two people can come to an understanding as long they're both willing to listen! That's what I've always believed!,5406
Shimakaze,Huh? Have I done something incorrectly?,5406
Shimakaze,Eek! What has gotten into you?! If I didn't know any better I'd think Well just this once I'll turn a blind eye to it.,5407
Shimakaze,Mweeehhh Please d-don't touch my ears! It makes me shooo weak Aaaahh,5407
Shimakaze,Mission completed! Quick let's check what rewards we've earned!,5408
Shimakaze,Apropos of nothing I think you should check your latest mail.,5408
Shimakaze,Hmm Commission teams don't run into ambushes out at sea do they?,5409
Shimakaze,I can become even faster even stronger!,5409
Shimakaze,Shall I assume command? Understood! I won't disappoint you!,5410
Shimakaze,All right! Another first-place finish!,5410
Shimakaze,I-I'll reflect upon my errors,5411
Shimakaze,Maybe I should turn this into one of my secret moves!,5411
Shimakaze,Don't die on me now engines Please hang in there!,5412
Shimakaze,If you manage to right all your wrongs then maybe you'll earn my forgiveness!,5412
Shimakaze,I am THE strongest destroyer! Or so I'd like to think. But to truly become the strongest I'll have to hone myself through my training and sorties!,5413
Shimakaze,People often say I'm too hasty but isn't swift decision-making supposed to be a good thing? Plus if you don't fight with all you've got it could come back to haunt you! Hehehe!,5413
Shimakaze,What is THIS?! Wasn't this meant to be an emergency mission briefing?! Wait what's this ring? I fell for it hook line and sinker! But why trick me into coming? I would've agreed to it if you'd just told the truth!,5414
Shimakaze,To protect what's dear what matters isn't the weapon in your hands but the will in your heart. Wouldn't you say that's true?,5414
Shimakaze,My rigging is in tip-top condition! I feel like I could take on the world today!,5415
Shimakaze,I'm not THE fastest – I just happen to be the fastest ship! After all one should not ever outrun humility.,5415
Shimakaze,Long-range torpedo strikes are my specialty but I don't suppose there is any way this fleet can leverage that.,5416
Shimakaze,At least you didn't touch my ears. The outcome wouldn't have been worksafe Ugh,5416
Shimakaze,Mweeehhh,5417
Shimakaze,Mission completed! I went ahead and brought you the rewards!,5417
Shimakaze,I've confirmed the commission team's safe return to port! A peaceful journey is always best!,5418
Shimakaze,In the event we lose please don't take it out on me!,5418
Shimakaze,The Shimakaze Fleet can make even the impossible happen!,5419
Shimakaze,Sweetheart? I'd love to have dinner with you after work then go shopping together. I wish we'd have more time for ourselves even if I'd always want more of it. Hehehe~ Got to make the most of what we can get though right?,5419
Shimakaze,Abukuma invited me to go fishing with her! So I'm going out to meet– Y-you think it's best if I change clothes first?,5420
Shimakaze,Suruga! You should try a bunny girl costume too! Y-you wouldn't be caught dead in one? Isn't that a little extreme even for an aversion?!,5420
Shimakaze,These frills fit around my ears perfectly! Which is good because I'd become lethargic if they were too tight,5421
Shimakaze,There being no danger of skirt-flipping doesn't make this tolerable behavior!,5421
Shimakaze,Outstanding work! I will provide tonight's entertainment act! As soon as I come up with something entertaining Hmm,5422
Shimakaze,I'm truly in my element in this outfit!,5422
Shimakaze,I'm the fastest strongest destroyer And that's a fact!,5423
Shimakaze,After much thinking I've realized that I'm not Alice but rather the White Rabbit! So isn't it weird that I'm lost in here?,5423
Shimakaze,The sheer scale of this set is staggering! I've run around all over the place and still found no sign of the exit What?! I've been going in circles all this time?!,5424
Shimakaze,If Suruga was here how would she Wait COULD Suruga even find a way out of this place? Because I am completely out of ideas!,5424
Shimakaze,There's the exit! Watch I'm going to make a mad dash for– Owie! Th-this is just a dang mirror!,5425
Shimakaze,Mhm! Allow me to show you the right path to your destination!,5425
Shimakaze,At least it's not my No ears or not it's embarrassing when you touch me like that!,5426
Shimakaze,Laffey could find a way out if she were here Whoa! Word of a new mission just came in!,5426
Shimakaze,The commission team has come back! But as it stands now we can't meet them!,5427
Shimakaze,Hippity hoppity! That's what happens when you underestimate me!,5427
Shimakaze,Naganami must surely hate getting her tail wet One could say the same about my ears I suppose.,5428
Shimakaze,Now now Kii please don't try to pressure Suruga into Wow! You'll really let me take her place in the beach volleyball tournament?,5428
Shimakaze,I don't need sunscreen – I can simply dart in and out of the shade! Fwoosh fwoosh!,5429
Shimakaze,Whatever it is you need I'm all ears.,5429
Shimakaze,Do you think this is acceptable in broad daylight?! Please!,5430
Shimakaze,I fight at peak performance even in this swimsuit!,5430
Shimakaze,I'm almost more scared of being pursued by sharks than the enemy,5431
Shiranui, Touch me in the wrong way and you will die.,5431
Shiranui,I am bad at dealing with hotheads.,5432
Shiranui,"You're standing beside me because I have a ""cooling aura""? Are you an idiot?",5432
Shiranui,Enjoying yourself are you?,5433
Shiranui,You have a thing for ghosts? You really are something,5433
Shiranui,It seems we have a new mission However I do not care either way.,5434
Shiranui,"Rewards"" have arrived Ah do not task me with collecting them you may do it yourself.",5434
Shiranui,"You seem to have ""mail"" I should not have to help you with this too",5435
Shiranui,You may stare all you wish but it will not make me start floating,5435
Shiranui,I waited 1 whole minute for you yet you did not realize that a commission had been completed It really is true you are a big fool who cannot do anything if I am not around.,5436
Shiranui,You certainly are a big fool spending such precious resources on me,5436
Shiranui,Allow me to show you all my combat techniques,5437
Shiranui,I never imaged they would be this weak,5437
Shiranui,Curses upon you all,5438
Shiranui,O will-o'-wisps join me for this strike,5438
Shiranui,There exists no cure for your stupidity,5439
Shiranui,I will come in the dead of night and devour you soul I said and you actually believed it? It was in fact my embers that chased away so many pests and yet you thought I would harm you? You tremendous fool,5439
Shiranui,"*Sigh* Would it not have been better if I could have been your guardian angel instead Then I could always intervene I mean ""protect"" you when need be.",5440
Shiranui,Here Valentine's chocolate Unlike that Akashi I'm not charging you for it. But if you like it I might put it on my shelves,5440
Shiranui,Good day. I am here to deliver your Valentine's chocolate. You seemed keenly interested in this item in question and so I poured much effort into making it. With that I wish you a pleasant Valentine's Day.,5441
Shiranui,You seem surprised to find me here when I should be watching the store I'm sure you can figure out why that is if you use your head for a moment. If you deduced that it's to give you my Valentine's chocolate you are correct. Thank you for your continued patronage and affection.,5441
Shiranui,If you have this much money remaining then you may visit me and spend it with confidence A discount you say? Of course Someday I shall give you one,5442
Shiranui,My will-o'-wisps burn stronger than before *Giggle* this is the power of money I'm merely jesting of course.,5442
Shiranui,Work diligently and you will only be a fool by your appearance.,5443
Shiranui,I take my work both as a secretary and shopkeeper seriously If I feel like it I could offer you a 5% discount.,5443
Shiranui,Yes yes your wish has been heard. Please make your way yonder to amuse yourself with my will-o'-wisps.,5444
Shiranui,Groping a shopkeeper like this is surely not a turn-on of yours?,5444
Shiranui,Gawking won't earn you a *Groan* Then just for beverages I could give you F-fifty percent off.,5445
Shiranui,Happy Mid-Autumn Festival I hope I said that right?,5445
Shiranui,Lotus seed mooncakes osmanthus mooncakes five-nut mooncakes If it sells well it's a good mooncake wouldn't you agree?,5446
Shiranui,These mooncakes are one hundred percent authentic unlike the tech p Err I didn't say anything.,5446
Shiranui,That dumb Akashi why'd she have to go and order so many of these when am I going to be able to clear out this stock?,5447
Shiratsuyu,Weird lately I seem to forget what I'm forgetting What am I gonna do,5447
Shiratsuyu,We've got a job to do! This time I won't forget!,5448
Shiratsuyu,look out get out of the way! My breaks aren't working!,5448
Shiratsuyu,Huh? Where are we? Oh no it's the enemy!,5449
Shiratsuyu,Ah! Now I remember what I wanted to say! But you said it first even though I wanted to be the first to say it,5449
Shiratsuyu,Hehehe it's funny how for once you're the one who's lost~ I looked all over for you so I could give you this chocolate. All that walking made me tired and I thought about eating it myself though By the way where is everyone?,5450
Shiratsuyu,H-here they come Your order and your cutesy dutesy maid Whoaahh! I'm sorry! Look out!,5450
Shiratsuyu,*Sob* I messed up again,5451
Shirayuki,I see so that's how your footsteps sound I'll commit it to memory.,5451
Shirayuki,Why does everyone want to touch my ears? What's so special about them?,5452
Shirayuki,I like the scritchy-scratchy noise paper makes when you write on it. It's relaxing.,5452
Shirayuki,Fubuki's always bursting with energy whenever I see her. I'm honestly impressed with her,5453
Shirayuki,A carrot? Uhh no thanks? What do you think I am? A rabbit?,5453
Shirayuki,More new missions Ugh Could I call over Fubuki for some extra help?,5454

Shirayuki,I I don't want to hear your noise,5459
Shirayuki,I've not heard anything suspicious today And that's a good thing.,5459
Shirayuki,I don't like crowds. All the noise they make gives me headaches I much prefer quiet places.,5460
Shirayuki,We could share an umbrella on a rainy day go for a walk and just listen to the sound of the raindrops Hm? Did I say something out loud just now?,5460
Shirayuki,Can I snuggle you up for a minute? Thanks I can hear your heart going ba-thump ba-thump. It's really soothing~,5461
Shirayuki,Everyone expects me to make something so I made some carrot chocolate. You can have some since you love touching my ears all the time. Personally I don't really like carrots so I haven't tasted it much It'll probably be good though.,5461
Shirayuki,"Today it's my turn to look after the bunnies. No I said ""look after"" not ""be looked after by.",5462
Shirayuki,Maybe I should also bring some hay along with the carrots No Fubuki! You can't feed that stuff to a bunny!,5462
Shirayuki,I guess the ears really are the first thing people go for when they see a bunny No I'm talking about bunnies not me!,5463
Shirayuki,Oh to be a happy rabbit spending my days eating sleeping and playing with humans,5463
Shirayuki,There's a lot you have to keep in mind when playing with a bunny. For starters,5464

Shoukaku,This is the privilege of being the elder sister!,5482
Shoukaku,Pump water to the other side! Hurry!,5483
Shoukaku,My sister Zuikaku and I held on for two years during the darkest of times. If only our senpai could have worked a little bit harder.,5483
Shoukaku,Do I hold a grudge against the First and Second Carrier Divisions? Of course~ For them to leave us behind like that wouldn’t anyone complain in that situation?,5484
Shoukaku,Those senpai are so sly! Just when I was about to overtake them they went somewhere I could never reach! How unfair!,5484
Shoukaku,The melody of my flute is like a flowing river requiring an inspiration that usually can only be found atop a mountain. Just being by your side however inspires me even more.,5485
Shoukaku,All flowers must wither all leaves must fall and all dances must end But right now forget about all that and lose yourself in the moment.,5485
Shoukaku,Zuikaku you're being too nervous. Just do what your sister tells you to. First relax just relax,5486
Shoukaku,Before the banquet begins shall we practice one more time?,5486
Shoukaku,Who will be the star of tonight's show? Will it be me or us? Hehe~,5487
Shoukaku,I hear a little tune that's not coming from the banquet What could it be~?,5487
Shoukaku,Because it's a special occasion I'll call a one-day truce with those seniors of mine~,5488
Shoukaku,The flowers scatter in the wind,5488

Sirius,"Happy Valentine's Day my honourable Master. I hope you'll savour this chocolate I made for you It looks ""ordinary""? Well I followed your and my sisters' advice to a T Or are you suggesting that you're more interested in me than the chocolate?",5513

Sirius,My perceptive Master would there happen to be dust clinging to my dress?,5524
Sirius,If you wish me to service you in these Dragon Empery garments then Oh my apologies! I've made yet another careless assumption,5525
Sirius,My outfit is unsafe to wear in windy weather? Are you concerned with my wellbeing and would not want me catching a cold? Oh honourable Master your thoughtfulness humbles me!,5525
Smalley,There are very few restrictions to what you can do in kickboxing. However it's not very useful in naval combat so that's why it's just a hobby.,5526

Smalley,I screwed up last year because I had no idea what I was doing. This time it went much better after I took to viewing chocolate-making as a form of training. I haven't tasted it myself since the sugar would affect my workouts Is it any good?,5533
Smalley,It wasn't easy to strike a balance between taste and caloric content while making it easy for the body to efficiently convert it into energy. At any rate this chocolate is the fruit of my Valentine's research! It's not overly sweet and it's got a lot of bang for your buck.,5534
Smalley,Let's use this jack-o-lantern to decorate your office. I'm putting it right here.,5534

Soobrazitelny,Th-th-this is mechanically impossible!,5547
Soobrazitelny,Others can fix your machines when they break but only you can make up for the mistakes you've made Comrade!,5548
Soobrazitelny,In contrast to the beauty of Mother Nature the beauty of machinery lies in its unique status as the culmination of millennia of humanity's technological development! That is why I'm so in love with it all!,5548
Soobrazitelny,Hmgh! Hurmph! What am I up to? Working on my rigging obviously. Don't worry about the parts rough around the edges – I'll just sandpaper those down later! Ahh-ha-ha-haah!,5549
Soobrazitelny,Would you be interested in building a small device Comrade? I don't mean rigging repair tools I mean something practical you yourself could use! Of course you'll have a genius to teach you every step of the process!,5549
Soobrazitelny,It's true I talk about machinery all day and yes I build and tinker day in and day out but that doesn't mean I'm a mechaphile or that I want to date a robot Y-you see what I'm getting at right?!,5550
Soobrazitelny,My prediction was spot-on – I knew you'd make the first move! Heheheh! I love you too Comrade! One might say My love for you is as strong as the hardest steel! Maybe that analogy doesn't make sense but you know what I'm trying to say! Hahahah!,5550
Soobrazitelny,"Let's see Top with a normal amount of powdered sugar? How much is ""a normal amount""?! I guess this will do! Comrade I just finished your Valentine's chocolate! Savor this mechanic's genius given chocolatey form! Ahh-ha-ha-haah!",5551
Soobrazitelny,Welcome back Comrade! Oh mind your step around the components on the floor! Without really thinking I turned your office into a second workshop. Hah-ha-ha-haah!,5551
Soobrazitelny,WHAT?! Dust is upon us! Comrade open the window at once! Or else your screens will be ruined!,5552
Soobrazitelny,The grinding of gears the whizzing of a propeller the ringing that tickles my heart Whuh?! Hey! What are you touching me for Comrade?!,5552
Soobrazitelny,Another one of plastic's shortcomings is the difficulty in fixing it. How so? Well if I were to WHACK it it would simply break – unlike metal.,5553
Soobrazitelny,Comrade! What are your thoughts on the Soobrazitelny-brand Automatic Door Closer? Now you'll never need to close the door manually again! I'll fix the frame damage caused during installation later!,5553

Soobrazitelny,Yes these data and results are quite interesting Though they mean nothing to me! I am a genius mechanic not an analyst! Ahh-ha-ha-haah!,5558
Soobrazitelny,Nuoooo! I spilled your cup of coffee Comrade! This is bad! Terrible even!,5558
Soobrazitelny,Quite the useful fish tank we have here Or is it technically an aquarium? I confuse the two sometimes,5559
Soobrazitelny,This outfit makes me look both intelligent and sexy at the same time. What an ingenious combination! Mwah-ha-ha-haah!,5559
Soobrazitelny,The screen went black again! So be it Hurmph! Owwww! I forgot I'm not wearing my regular gloves!,5560

Souryuu,I am Souryuu of the Morals Committee. Our goal is to maintain public decency increase student motivation and *Ahem*! Anyway please allow me to oversee the school's moral codes!,5574
Souryuu,I think Hiryuu is in her rebellious age She won't wear the clothes I picked out for her and she won't walk to school with me As her sister it's making me feel a little bummed out.,5575
Souryuu,I may be in the Morals Committee but that doesn't mean I want to become a fusspot.,5575
Souryuu,Please don't joke like that. My disciplined respectful dependable good-mannered and very well-raised little sister would never end up as a dirty delinquent!,5576
Souryuu,Hiryuu's in her rebellious age *Sigh* Perhaps it's best to leave her alone for a while,5576
Souryuu,I have my planes monitoring every nook and cranny of the school. I recommend you don't do anything that would oppose school conduct.,5577
Souryuu,I've been talking to Hiryuu less yet her mood hasn't improved at all S-she's not going to run away from home is she?!,5577
Souryuu,All planes prepare for takeoff! No wait prepare to strike!,5578
Souryuu,She welcomed back the commission team just like always She is at the point of her life where she wants to spread her wings and be free,5578
South_Dakota,I'm ready to move out anytime.,5579
South_Dakota,If this is what you want to do,5579
South_Dakota,The commission teams are back If it is necessary send me off as well.,5580
South_Dakota,My shields have become stronger,5580
South_Dakota,Come at me with all you got!,5581
South_Dakota,This is your stop!,5581
South_Dakota,I won't hold back now!,5582
South_Dakota, I shall follow your orders.,5582
South_Dakota,Here's a Valentine's present. I'm uh grateful as always. And I how should I put this h-hope we can stay together like this (Blushes),5583
South_Dakota,Happy Valentine's. I made you this chocolate. What? Is there something on my face? Sorry it might be a splotch of chocolate Could you umm take care of that for me?,5583
South_Dakota,"Finally got you. This cat swiped the chocolate I was planning to give you and ran off with it. Every time I get near you something strange ends up happening This must be a message from ""fate."" Heh.",5584
South_Dakota,Massachusetts suggested I learn something useful that's unrelated to combat so I started playing the piano It seemed impossible at first but after actually trying it I've developed a pretty good feel for it.,5584
South_Dakota,What song should I play for you today,5585
South_Dakota,Aurora asked me to perform with her I guess it can't hurt to try.,5585
South_Dakota,I can't get used to this flimsy dress. I'd rather wear my regular clothes,5586
South_Dakota,My cat goes for the keyboard when I'm not playing Do you want to practice the piano too kitty?,5586
South_Dakota,We can express so much through music. I suppose that's fitting for someone bad at expressing their feelings like I am.,5587
South_Dakota,Everyone's back safe and sound. Now I can resume practicing with peace of mind.,5587
Southampton,The maids would be running ragged right about now I am terribly unsuited to that sort of work.,5588
Southampton,Honour guard? Bite your tongue! I am a Royal Knight under the command of King George V!,5588
Southampton,Are you tired? Well then let's lie down for a nap shall we?,5589
Southampton,I-I'm not a maid!  Err rather you can't do that to a maid either!,5589
Southampton,A mission is it? There's still a bit of time until the deadline. I think we can worry about it later don't you? Hehehe.,5590
Southampton,The mission rewards came in! Now there's no rush but you'd better not forget to collect them.,5590
Southampton,Who's the letter from this time?,5591
Southampton,Must we go meet the commission team? Very well. Let's head straight back for a rest afterwards. Hehe~,5591
Southampton,I've grown stronger! But I do hope you won't increase my workload. Hehehe.,5592
Southampton,W-wait a tick! Don't go charging on ahead like that!,5592
Southampton,We have seized the day! Yaay!,5593
Southampton,Aieeee! L-let us beat a hasty retreat!,5593
Southampton,I do what I must!,5594
Southampton,Aieeee! Pl-please settle down!,5594
Southampton,It's not like everything needs to be done one hundred percent perfectly all the time. Just take it easy. It's good enough for government work. You need to cut loose more often.,5595
Southampton,You enjoyed my cooking? Hooray! I asked Sheffield to give me some pointers and put my heart and soul into it. Ehehe.,5595
Southampton,What's wrong? I'm perfectly capable of working without slacking off if it's for your sake~,5596
Southampton,I-I guess it's fine You did give me a ring,5596
Southampton,Wait the mission's deadline is right in front of us?! There's no time left to procrastinate is there Oh no,5597
Southampton,It's time to greet the commission team right? Let's stroll over leisurely just as Newcastle does.,5597
Southampton,I'm still a member of the Royal Knights you know!,5598
Southampton,A glorious victory befitting a member of the Royal Knights! Ehehe~,5598
Southampton,That one weird trick that I told you about earlier? It's going on a date with me! Ehehe I guess you get what I meant now? After you finish working? Fine I guess I have no other choice. I'll help you out a little bit!,5599
Southampton,Hello there~! Royal Knight Southampton is reporting for duty in a Sakura-style outfit! Hehe don't you have something to tell me about my new look like how cute it is? Come on don't be shy. Speak up~,5599
Southampton,Dressing up all Sakura style has me feeling like I want to listen to some Sakura music. Ehehe.,5600
Southampton,"I think this here is the ""Demon Breaker Arrow"" isn't it? Seems to be some kind of warding charm brilliant!",5600
Southampton,I find myself wanting to dive into all the girls' festivals now~ What delightful holiday do we have next? I'm so excited!,5601
Southampton,What do you say we do a bit of New Year's rearranging in the office here make it a little easier to faff abo Ahem easier to polish off those official duties. Hehe.,5601
Southampton,Do you get how it feels to kick back and let loose to some heavenly music now? Ehehe.,5602
Southampton,I mean this is something all the Royal Maids can do. Even I've learned most of the skills necessary for being a maid.,5602
Southampton,I thought it'd be nice if we didn't have to play music live but Her Majesty demanded that we provide live music for her at the venue,5603
Southampton,An encore? Alright. Here's a special song just for you~,5603
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Aha! I knew you'd be back right at this hour Comrade! Rossiya doubted my intuition.,5604
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,If excellency is what you seek from the Sovetsky Soyuz class I am your best and only true option!,5604
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,It's much more entertaining to lure your foes into a trap one at a time than to crush them all at once. Am I right?,5605
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Seems it's all quiet on the western front Don't you have any palpitating news?,5605
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,There is no greater pleasure than decimating your enemy with minimal losses. Wouldn't you agree?,5606
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Let me guess you are simply poking me for your own amusement and not because you need something done. Am I wrong?,5606
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,You chose the most depraved of ways to prove you have guts Comrade.,5607
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Your little hand gestures have no effect on me.,5607
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Comrade sure we should not allow the glorious advance of our fleet to be delayed by such trifling missions.,5608
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Fantastic. With HQ's missions complete we can finally continue with our own plan.,5608
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,A letter? I welcome correspondence assuming it is an enthralling read.,5609
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Do not be so lenient with the enemy next time Comrade.,5609
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Interested in a bet Comrade? Do you think the commission team has returned with bountiful rewards or few at all?,5610
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,We will curb the enemy with our superior firepower! Hahaha!,5610
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Crush the enemy! Break their spirits then their bones!,5611
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,This comes as no surprise. All I did was nudge those fools toward the annihilation they so desired.,5611
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Everyone makes mistakes I suppose,5612
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Cease your pointless struggling!,5612
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,The battle is still under our control!,5613
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,I don't care. You are absolutely nothing to me. Just stay out of my way.,5613
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,How about a bet Comrade? Do you think your job will only be accomplished thanks to my help or regardless of it?,5614
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Oh so you don't mind losing a bet if it means you get my help? I see. Well regardless it doesn't matter who wins a bet made on the spur of the moment. Now what do you need assistance with Comrade?,5614
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,If you ever tire of managing the fleet and planning battles I will take over for you. You can rest easy knowing I will bring you good reports on the daily. Although knowing your devotion to your job I doubt you'd ever delegate it to get some rest.,5615
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,You don't mince your words do you? I will say I do prefer a forthright confession of love over beating around the bush. Standing at the top of the world gazing at the horizon with you by my side – I like the sound of that. Ahahaha!,5615
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,You hope this ring will forever connect me with you do you? Then I believe it will because I believe in you. Only you are capable of standing at the top of the world together with me. Do not let me down Comrade.,5616
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Impressive. You've received chocolate from all these people me included. Seems I had no reason to worry. Oh not about you getting chocolate at all but whether or not you'd get mine first What? You were hoping to get mine first all along?,5616
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Why are you hiding over there Comrade? You were waiting for me to show up and hid so no one else could give you chocolate before me? Hahahah! That's exactly what I would do in your position. Great minds think alike!,5617
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,You've come Comrade. As punctual as always.,5617
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,That's checkmate. Hey hey throwing in the towel already? What you're making it seem like I'm bullying you or something~,5618
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,The port sure is peaceful just as it should be. Violence should have no place outside the battlefield.,5618
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Hey hey I didn't call you here to make you all hot and bothered.,5619
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,All right. After we finish these missions you should go back to pursuing your own ambitions.,5619
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Letters huh? Let's take a look Wouldn't want to miss out on anything juicy.,5620
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,There is no harm in prolonging the suffering of our foes but do not forget the reason why we are here Comrade.,5620
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,What you wanna bet on whether or not our commission fleet is bringing back a big haul? Nah no need for that. We pretty much know the outcome already.,5621
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,To pass the time by proactively reading or by passively enjoying the company of others Ah good morning Comrade I've been expecting you. Hahaha!,5621
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Take it easy. There are many ways to kill time. Just pick one which feels sound.,5622
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,What's your favorite book Comrade? I'm asking out of curiosity and to have something to recommend to Soyuz and Rossiya.,5622
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Anyone's life can be enriched by having many diverse interests. Even I enjoy the odd girly hobby or two.,5623
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,Oh please don't toot your own horn Comrade. I know several destroyers who read advanced literature too.,5623
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,I need to get up and move around a bit. My joints start aching if I sit down for too long.,5624
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,What did my revealing outfit cause you a lapse of judgment?,5624
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,I see you've all returned in one piece. Your reputation has further improved as a result.,5625
Sovetskaya_Belorussiya,There's no point in betting on a sure outcome! Onwards!,5625
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,A report I submitted went missing? Pardon my negligence. I'll make it up so please don't tell the others about this matter.,5626
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,I hope that you can command from a global perspective. After all the responsibility on your shoulders is much greater than just that of an individual.,5626
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,"When I was inspecting my rigging I noticed a few more screws than last time Hm an unexpected ""increase in resource allocation?"" That's a good thing right?",5627
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Your tactics are too conservative! As long as it has not been sunk it can repaired learned from strengthened and optimized Continuing this cycle is the best way of fighting.,5627
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,You want to deepen our camaraderie? Very good let us start by making a firm handshake part of our regular routine.,5628
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,This is not polite behavior.,5628
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Hm? Something missing from the reward manifest? It should be generally correct,5629
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Rest. And tell me now of what glorious victory you have won or how you turn defeat to our advantage.,5629
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Military commissions? They are part of the logistical aspect of proper fleet management.,5630
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,An excellent strengthening. The next one should be so good.,5630
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Kill confirmed. You cannot stop the Northern Parliament You cannot stop our righteous liberation!,5631
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Gah how humiliating to think a material defect would surface at a time like this!,5631
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Blow them away!,5632
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,It's not fatal damage!,5632
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,This negative attitude is unacceptable. You must be forcibly reeducated.,5633
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Your fleet must be an iron curtain Hm it's a metaphorical expression My meaning is that I hope to see this fleet stand united just like our Northern Parliament.,5633
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,So long as I draw breath I labor to carry out my mission. Not only as a member of this fleet but also in service of the bonds you have forged This is not a product of rational thinking alone but also a decision born of my subjective opinion.,5634
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,This port has such abundance. That leaves me one core duty. I must bring emotional enrichment to your life.,5634
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,I need only focus my attentions on battle? That is a reasonable decision But does it mean my clerical skills did not pass muster?,5635
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,"Is this what the Iris would call a ""breach of etiquette?",5635
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,"Situation normal in all sectors of the facility"" Oh it is you. I was just giving Minsk the daily report. Do you have something?",5636
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Facility inspection watch patrol and observations conducted in accordance with regulations. Everything running smoothly.,5636
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,What is the most efficient way to dispose of Ooh? I mean the refuse. Spare me that look of concern.,5637
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,You find me more reliable than Gangut? I am glad you see my value but I find that a very low bar to clear.,5637
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,This is all in service of a greater cause. The girls have fully committed their labor. You need not trouble yourself.,5638
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Document classification protocols? I was trying to find the required materials but seem to have created a bit of a mess in the process,5638
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Now your hand For today's handshake. I am not going to clap you in irons. Relax.,5639
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Hmph. Do you want to be handcuffed?,5639
Sovetskaya_Rossiya,Freeze! Comply!,5640

St._Louis,You should drink a little something to warm yourself up before getting to work.,5649

Surcouf,You appointed me as your secretary because you were so enamored with my gorgeous body weren't you? Spot on aren't I~? Don't be so shy I won't get upset with you~,5702
Surcouf,Eat a lot sleep a lot fight a lot! And everything else is your responsibility I think I can dig this way of life~,5703
Surcouf,Okay let's see what rewards we got today!,5703
Surcouf,Ooh! I found something nice amongst the rewards,5704
Surcouf,They're just slightly bigger targets! On y va!,5704
Surcouf,Winning makes me sleepy somehow,5705
Surcouf,Aren't we practically made for each other? It's not every day you find people as closely in synch as we are~ Say isn't it time we become a couple now?,5705
Surcouf,So you wanna chain Surcouf to your side with this ring? Jeez aren't you greedy~ But since it's you I might be fine with it,5706
Surcouf,Heheh! I've called dibs on you for the whole day today! So this is where we'll go and this here's the route we'll take. And don't worry we'll be back before anyone starts worrying~,5706
Surcouf,This scooter really is fantastic! A good buy for a good price~ Lucky me,5707
Surcouf,My twin-gun turrets are also on vacation today! Gotta work hard and play hard!,5707
Surcouf,Uhh I don't think I'll bring the puppy with me next time He's way too jumpy and almost even fell off the scooter once,5708
Surcouf,Sure I go in the water all the time since I'm a submarine but it's nice to just relax by the beach every now and then! *yaaaawn* A girl needs her vacation time you know~,5708
Surcouf,You're head over heels for my gorgeous body aren't you? Heheh stare all you want because I don't mind,5709
Surcouf,Welcome back Comma– Whuah! Geesh that last wave was huge! You could've warned me that it was coming! Hmph!,5709
Suruga,Let's focus our attention on our work today. Don't be afraid to ask for my help should you need it.,5710
Suruga,I've noticed those Priority ships are strikingly individualis– Pardon I mean they have striking personalities. Not that I'm jealous or anything of the sort.,5710
Suruga,I believe I'm better suited for a desk job where I can analyze data and draft new plans. The reason being my strengths lie in quickly reading memorizing and writing documents.,5711
Suruga,Reckless hotheads and I don't get along particularly well. So I've learned first-hand through bad experiences with a certain someone That is not to say I hate those kinds of people however.,5711
Suruga,I'm deeply grateful that you've elected me as your secretary. However I would absolutely welcome the addition of more people to the office as we're rather short-staffed with just me here.,5712
Suruga,I'm not a fan of battling but if anyone picks a fight with me then a fight they'll get. We were made to wage war and so that is our responsibility.,5712
Suruga,Life is so peaceful at this port. For that we can thank the many girls here who I don't hold as much as a candle to.,5713
Suruga,Whuah?! What are you doing?!,5713
Suruga,I hope my horns were left alone Phew they were Err no! Never mind I said anything!,5714
Suruga,I've brought the mission rewards with me. Phew,5714
Suruga,It appears you have new mail. I'll confirm it on your behalf.,5715
Suruga,Nicely done out there. Please don't mind me go ahead and take some time to relax.,5715
Suruga,The commission team has returned. Shall we set out to greet them?,5716
Suruga,It's meaningless to fight if you cannot win. As such a few enhancements may prove necessary.,5716
Suruga,The Suruga Fleet w-will not disappoint!,5717
Suruga,Fools! I've– I mean we've won!,5717
Suruga,Whatever it's done and over now Look I don't want everyone to see this!,5718
Suruga,I'm gonna smash you to pieces!,5718
Suruga,Oh for crying out loud! Just my luck!,5719
Suruga,*Sigh* I set myself up for disappointment by expecting any decent treatment Can I at least ask you to not go too hard on me?,5719
Suruga,P-please! Offer your concern to other girls instead of me! You really don't need to constantly check how I'm doing just because I'm serving as your secretary!,5720
Suruga,Look I do appreciate your concern but you saying that in front of everyone is embarrassing! Could you not put me on the spot like that again? That'd be great!,5720
Suruga,Too much work to process? We all know what a tough job it is to command a fleet. So please let me give you some assistance.,5721
Suruga,I don't mind fading into the background when I'm with my friends but when I'm with you I want everyone to see it. Heheh in a friendly way of course.,5721
Suruga,Once the war has ended then we can discuss everything we'll do once the war ends. For now we must focus all our efforts on fighting to eventually achieve peace.,5722
Suruga,Hahah I know how much you enjoy doing lewd things like this.,5722
Suruga,Headpats headpatty pat patty patty head heady heady pat pat~ Ahahah!,5723
Suruga,Let's see here I think you should review these missions.,5723
Suruga,Welcome back. As much as I want you to be successful I'm just as happy with everything staying the way it is.,5724
Suruga,I don't want to do this but you leave me no choice!,5724
Suruga,You know everything about me from my horns to my personality. Since we're so intimate I suppose it's needless to tell you Actually there's one thing I want to tell you: I will NOT go along with your flirting when we're in the office!,5725
Suruga,I always end up oversleeping on the day after the holiday's over *Sigh* Me dropping the ball when it really matters is not funny at all.,5725
Suruga,"Treasure every moment of peace you get"" as someone once said. We're only simple ""people"" after all.",5726
Suruga,Y-you don't need to stare at me,5726
Suruga,I owe my thanks to the girls who prepared this outfit for me. It'll help me get through the holidays without personally standing out. It'll have the opposite effect? Huh?!,5727
Suruga,Oh. Fancy meeting you here Walk to school together? Uh sure! I know the way so please just follow me.,5727
Suruga,If you need my help please inform me. For what it's worth paperwork is one of my strong suits.,5728
Suruga,Stupid Shimakaze Why hasn't she showed up? She's the one who asked me for supplemental lessons,5728
Suruga,You should probably not drink on the clock. You're meeting with Kii later today remember?,5729
Suruga,I'm a study machine when tests are coming up. Hehehe~ Also did you know? It's harder to get all questions wrong than to get them all right.,5729
Suruga,I'll draw unwanted attention if I do too good so I should get this question wrong on purp– Err nope I didn't say anything!,5730
Suruga,A-at least give me a heads-up first!,5730
Suruga,You've got mail. Maybe next time I'll get Shimakaze to deliver it to you.,5731
Suruga,It's good to see you again. Now if you'll excuse me I have reports to read through.,5731
Suruga,Yeah! That's proof my strength means something!,5732
Suruga,I've left your present under the tree Did you prepare a present for me as well?,5732
Suruga,Where's Kii gone off to? Actually knowing her she's spending Christmas drinking with her friends and having a great time. Me I have better things to do than get drunk! Hehe.,5733
Suruga,Shimakaze! Go get all the destroyers' presents and leave them under the tree!,5733
Suruga,After a year of hard work Christmas is finally upon us! And soon it'll be New Year's too! Whew.,5734
Suruga,Would you like an oversized sock? You can use it when you want a bigger present. Hehe.,5734
Suruga,No sneak-peeking at what's inside!,5735
Suruga,Try to keep an eye out so our presents don't get lost amid all the rewards.,5735
Sussex,No problem with work preparations? Don't wait until you find out that something is missing.,5736
Sussex,Shropshire's personality is also really troublesome though that girl is the type that won't let herself suffer just let her go.,5736
Sussex,For some people saying kind words is only hurting them. When it is time to be strict one must be strict.,5737
Sussex,If you have time to look at me why not do more work after it's done you can stare as long as you want.,5737
Sussex,If you are tired please rest I do not want to make you hang on stubbornly I just hope that you work hard when you should do so.,5738
Sussex,You should think of the most efficient way to accomplish the mission before proceeding you didn't forget to right?,5738
Sussex,Don't forget to check your mail.,5739
Sussex,Although there are many things to report but first of all good work.,5739
Sussex,Thank you I will work hard in the coming battles.,5740
Sussex,With the goal of not embarrassing the fleet let us go fight.,5740
Sussex,Don't think just winning is sufficient. There's still room for improvement.,5741
Sussex,Don't be sad it's my fault for not being a good captain.,5741
Sussex,Steadily and surely!,5742
Sussex,Everyone pull back the formation!,5742
Sussex,Big sis is just too easygoing spoiling you into this kind of person.,5743
Sussex,I just can't bear looking at big sis's attitude of being nice to everyone.,5743
Sussex,Big sis is willing to put in effort for anybody even if it's someone undeserving.. Hm? I'm not talking about you Are you saying that you think you're that type of person?,5744
Sussex,"The thing is when I tell her about this she will just smilingly rub my head and say ""Thank you Sussex though it's no problem for me"" before continuing on like that. How awful just thinking about it makes me angry.",5744
Sussex,Of course you're worthy of big sis's dedication though it's still not enough. You must be even better until I can't even move my eyes away from you.. sigh why is it me? Ah.,5745
Sussex,In the beginning I was strict because I just wanted to reduce big sis's burden though slowly. slowly i started to hope that you would become the best person in my heart. Right now you've already become that person.,5745
Sussex,Sister feels that the swimsuit is too revealing so doesn't like to wear at all. Hah I occasionally will feel that Sister should learn a bit about the daring of Shropshire.,5746
Sussex,Mm? Nothing much when at the beach you can do whatever you want to do I don't care. But I just don't know why seeing that face of yours makes me a little angry.,5746
Sussex,You really doesn't have much of a memory huh,5747
Sussex,Missions? I'll accompany you then What I haven't forgotten my duty as the secretary ship!,5747
Sussex,These ice-creams are did you buy them? Um Thanks,5748
Sussex,Why are you staring at me all this time? My outfit isn't that different as compared to the rest Y-You have other people to welcome right? Honestly,5748
Sussex,There isn't issues with progress at work right? If we keep on dilly-dallying here you definitely will need to work over-time!,5749
Sussex,Sister London is whew looks like I don't need to worry. Forget it as it's London sister I don't need to worry at all right?,5749
Sussex,R-Right now as we aren't in a mission or in battle relaxing a little is fine No we have to focus and take part in the ball too!,5750
Sussex,We can't lose to the other factions everyone - go for it!,5750
Suzutsuki,Welcome back! Got any new jobs? I'm down for anything!,5751
Suzutsuki,When my friends are counting on me I can feel power surging within me that makes me feel like I can do anything!,5751

Suzuya,Kumano please don't make trouble for Mogami all right? She's going to get a stomachache again,5765
Suzuya,We're sometimes called the Suzuya class but I still prefer being called the Mogami class. We all fought together during that war after all..,5765
Suzuya,Nnh So this is what you were after from the very beginning I knew it all along. I've always known this entire time Ehehehe~,5766
Suzuya,I've arranged the status of our current missions. Please look over them.,5766
Suzuya,The mission rewards have arrived. That is good news.,5767
Suzuya,We must apply what we've learned to future battles. Shall I prioritize writing the report first?,5767
Suzuya,The commission team has returned to port. What's next? Shall I go with you to greet them?,5768
Suzuya,My abilities have been enhanced. Well done.,5768
Suzuya,I won't run away again I swear it!,5769

Suzuya,It's time to get serious!,5770
Suzuya,As if this would be enough to make me turn back!,5771
Suzuya,Mogami may often fail to recognize her own worth but more and more people are starting to see how little you're worth.,5771
Suzuya,Would you like to learn more about the Mogami class? Very well I'll be glad to explain everything from the top. Which one of us would you like to hear about first?,5772
Suzuya,You're most interested in Suzuya? Of course I'd be glad to give you the details but just explaining things wouldn't be enough right?,5772
Suzuya,There's no point hiding it. I already know how you feel about me. Just shut up and give in to your feelings already!,5773
Swiftsure,Good morning. Here is your work for the day *Sigh*,5773
Swiftsure,Um sorry I made such a mess Sheffield tried to teach me how to clean but I'm a lot worse at it than I expected Ahaha,5774

Swiftsure,Get the timing right I should be able to do this!,5777
Swiftsure,I have to get the others to safety at least!,5778
Swiftsure,Fiji is always telling me to smile more. Is she right? Oh Sorry I must be boring you with this,5778
Swiftsure,I try and try but my chocolate never comes out as good as the Royal Maids' Even so I will keep doing the best I can as long as you're happy with my efforts. I may disappoint you sometimes but– You know what I shouldn't be getting moody over a little chocolate. Sorry. Ahahah,5779
Swiftsure,Good morning. Here is the outline for today's course. Please make sure to review it.,5779
Swiftsure,While I have served as a flagship before that has nothing to do with what's going on now. I have to be humble and learn from everyone.,5780
Swiftsure,I often see Edinburgh in the library. She's always grumbling about what's going on in the maid team or something,5780
Swiftsure,I look cute when wearing glasses? Err Um that wasn't my intention,5781
Swiftsure,I agreed to try on this outfit but I know these fancy outfits don't suit me H-huh I look gorgeous?! Thank you very much. Even if you're just trying to make me feel better I appreciate it,5781
Swiftsure,Hmm what should we do next? Why don't we see if there's anyone who needs help? Just sitting here idly somehow doesn't feel quite right,5782
Swiftsure,Um are you redecorating the office? Do you need me to help?,5782
Swiftsure,I got some red envelopes as gifts from my seniors in the fleet. Ahaha I'm not sure how I feel about this,5783
Swiftsure,If you're cold please feel free to use my shawl.,5783
Swiftsure,So I need to put this headband on I wonder what kind of hairstyle would be good? Um let's tie my hair up like this Actually maybe twintails would be better instead?,5784
Swiftsure,Everyone acts much more freely when they're at the beach. Do you think I should do the same? A-Alright I'll give it a try Y-Yo!,5784
Swiftsure,Um This outfit really is quite embarrassing,5785
Tallinn,You're astonishingly late. Did you want me to discipline you that badly?,5785
Tallinn,Focus on your work. What you need a break? If you've got the energy to complain you've got the energy to work.,5786
Tallinn,What do you need? Don't even think about making me do grunt work just because I'm your secretary.,5786
Tallinn,A letter has come in. I wonder who sent it,5787
Tallinn,Good work out there. Keep it up.,5787
Tallinn,Your job now is to go and show your gratitude to the returning commission team. Do it well and in a timely fashion.,5788
Tallinn,Just as it should be.,5788
Tallinn,Use your head before ordering me around. If you can't even do that much then I won't lift a finger for you.,5789
Tallinn,Don't like my scoldings? Then do better! You're not about to tell me you actually ENJOY being scolded I hope.,5789
Tallinn,I'm surprised you've actually taken my scoldings to heart. Hehe hahaha Since you like it when I tell you what to do I'll be more exact from now on.,5790
Tallinn,Hats off to you for clocking in on time. See? You can do it if you just try. Hehehe.,5790
Tallinn,If you've got time to make excuses you've got time to do your job.,5791
Tallinn,Do your job well and you'll be rewarded. Use your head and think up something good then I'll see what I can do. Hehehe~,5791
Tallinn,You're in need of some guidance aren't you?,5792
Tallinn,Hehehe. You know what? I'll let you have your fun for once.,5792
Tallinn,Do you really think this is all it takes to satisfy everyone? Exactly. Let that annoyance motivate you to do better.,5793
Tallinn,Make yourself at home. I don't like being uptight all the time.,5793
Tallinn,You have to live up to everyone's expectations and keep going no matter how tough things get. I'll be there to make sure you do.,5794
Tallinn,I suppose now's a good time for a nap,5794
Tallinn,Good work out there. Get some rest you've earned it.,5795
Tallinn,You're cutting it very close here. Five minutes early to everything – that's something you should practice.,5795
Tallinn,Always work at flank speed – the momentum you build up will keep you going. If you ever forget that I'll remind you as many times as it takes.,5796
Tallinn,What is it? I already told you – you're not ready to be a phone operator.,5796
Tallinn,Huh?! Now you're really asking for it,5797
Tallinn,You've completed a mission now go claim your rewards. Chop-chop we're on the clock here.,5797
Tallinn,Wow you solved that one quick. Keep it up.,5798
Tanikaze,I'm right here if you need me.,5798

Tanikaze,The butterfly flew Huh? Where did it? Hamakaze? Hamakaze?! Huh? Where are Urakaze and Isokaze? Where did? We said we'd all go to the beach so where did they go?,5806
Tanikaze,Ugh I want to invite Yukikaze but she's hard to approach,5807
Tanikaze,We're going to the beach so Isokaze shouldn't ask me to play warring states with her hopefully,5807
Tanikaze,Are my sisters over there?,5808
Tanikaze,Ugh I was just trying to get to the beach,5808
Tanikaze,How's this? I'd say the place looks much cleaner now. Uh-oh the bucket! Aww! I suppose I have more cleaning to do,5809
Tanikaze,W-welcome! I'm practicing my waitress skills for when I have to do it for real! Thinking about it is a bit nerve-wracking,5809
Tanikaze,Having a vacuum-cleaning robot sure is convenient. Maybe I can go help Hamakaze with all the time it's freed up,5810
Tanikaze,I just realized I've never given the little cutie that's always sitting on my head a name have I?,5810
Tanikaze,Oh you'll lend me a hand? Okay then you can take my broom.,5811

Tartu,Vauquelin is really athletic. Getting tired from exercising resting and getting hungry Oh sorry I started thinking about Dunkerque's sweets,5813
Tartu,According to the book Vauquelin recommended me what I should do in this situation is gather the evidence and detain the offender?,5813

Tartu,Eep! I've got to stay focused,5817
Tartu,Listen up me if I keep overthinking everything I won't notice what's going on around me and then won't be able to become a mature and compassionate woman,5818
Tartu,Nowadays when I think about you I end up even deeper in thought than ever Ah! I'm so sorry Just now I,5818
Tartu,Oh sorry. I got lost in my own thoughts worrying if Vauquelin had already given you chocolate and giving you mine would make it weird for you Assuming that's not the case here you go.,5819
Tartu,Eek! Ah I'm sorry I got too absorbed into thinking about you,5819
Tartu,Who's the MVP? Um Why's everyone looking at me?,5820
Tartu,It's fine to always be thinking about you? In that case. Huh? Didn't you just say it was fine? I sometimes feel like I could just daydream about you forever,5820
Tartu,The book I last read took place on the beach if I remember properly It was a murder mystery on the beach right?,5821
Tartu,McCall from the Eagle Union and Suffolk from the Royal Navy seem to get along really well. The two of them are pretty funny hehe.,5821

Tartu,I won't get washed away!,5822
Tartu,I could really go for one of Dunkerque's donuts right about now,5823

Tennessee,I'm used to your pace now after all this time. I've yet to get used to staying in a room all day If anything happens to me because of this it's all on you. Don't tell me you're gonna dodge the issue.,5831
Tennessee,If I take this it means I'm yours forever? Fine but on one condition; I want none of that 'You'll get hurt if you're in the battlefield' crap. I need some action every now and then!,5832
Tennessee,I know that look. You're bracing for something unexpected am I right? Heheh perfect. Giving you that impression was exactly my goal! Oh and if you think I didn't bring chocolate think again. 'Cause that's one thing you can take for granted.,5832
Thüringen,Hm I'm glad to see that you're as chipper as ever. Keep it up.,5833
Thüringen,All troubles that occur either have a reason or a trigger. Unless there are innocents tangled up in the problem it's best to lay low and wait.,5833
Thüringen,Be more confident with your opinions and openly state your opinions. If anyone dares to boo you down I'll teach them something about manners.,5834
Thüringen,Mm I'll have to disagree on this. Of course your word goes but would you mind hearing my thoughts out first?,5834
Thüringen,What's wrong? Got something against being watched? Ahaha you don't have to be all tense. I wasn't keeping watch over you I just wanted to observe your response.,5835
Thüringen,The things I tell you are merely suggestions to you. Ultimately you call the shots here.,5835
Thüringen,Hmph! This is payback for your insolent behavior. There's no need for me to continue being a doormat for you.,5836
Thüringen,Mission complete. I'll let you decide who you want to send to pick up the rewards.,5836
Thüringen,Here's some mail. I'd like you to check on them as soon as possible Later you say? Well I don't think there's anything urgent here so that sounds fine with me.,5837
Thüringen,Good work out there. Will you take a break? Or are you planning on getting right back to another mission? Either way I'll be here for you.,5837
Thüringen,The girls have returned from their commissions. I'm sure the morale of the girls at the port will go up if you go out and greet them personally.,5838
Thüringen,Hmm. Much obliged.,5838
Thüringen,Adequate preparation is half the battle.,5839
Thüringen,Seems we've taken far less damage than I'd anticipated. How fortuitous.,5839
Thüringen,I'll be back with some payback. Nobody likes to stay a loser.,5840
Thüringen,This is it!,5840
Thüringen,You're quite skilled but I won't fall that easily!,5841
Thüringen,I'll serve my duties as your subordinate but don't expect me to be all smiles while doing so.,5841
Thüringen,Nobody not even I can meddle with your thoughts. Of course due to our differences in standing values and information I may disagree with you from time to time. But I will never disparage your authority over me.,5842
Thüringen,Maybe because we have good chemistry together but I feel very comfortable being around you whether for work or for personal matters. Even if we disagree on something we come to understand each other's positions very quickly. I hope we can continue getting along just as well as we have.,5842
Thüringen,This kind of proposal works best when our feelings are reciprocal—basically we accept each other as partners. When we have differing opinions as long as we work together hand-in-hand we can overcome any obstacle that stands in our path! Ahaha!,5843
Thüringen,I made you this chocolate to repay you for all you do. What do you think? Tell me your honest opinion on the taste even if it's not positive. Knowing what's good and what could be better is the first step to improving yourself.,5843
Thüringen,Hm I'm glad to see that you're as chipper as ever. You look like you're ready to take on the world today.,5844
Thüringen,I don't make any pointless remarks when you're making decisions. Previously it was because of my respect for you but now it's because my heart can't help but trust in all you do.,5844
Thüringen,I've collected a list of good locations for the two of us just as you directed me to While I'm aware that this isn't a date and that you just wanted to make your rounds I'm not opposed to it being a date as well.,5845
Thüringen,You consider my opinions very important? Thank you very much for trusting in me. But the same goes for me.,5845
Thüringen,I'll let you off this once. Make sure to hold yourself back next time.,5846
Thüringen,Good work out there. Will you take a break or are you planning on getting back to work? Either way I've made arrangements for whatever you choose.,5846
Thüringen,This set is unbelievably big Ahaha there's no way I'd have any complaints. However I definitely want the girl who prepared this set to experience what cleaning this humongous space feels like.,5847
Thüringen,Speaking of which what is this set even used for well I guess it's fine. It's not something for me to worry about.,5847
Thüringen,That poor-looking Royal Maid taught me how to clean things up Ahaha it's not the kind of cleaning that you're thinking about just regular cleaning.,5848
Thüringen,Lützow I'm not telling you not to play with the manjuu but make sure you carry those things to Akashi once you're done you hear?,5848
Thüringen,Though you shouldn't be helping me clean if you insist there's no way I'd turn you down.,5849
Thüringen,Nice work. I was just about to take a break myself. Would you like me to help you with anything?,5849
Theseus,Good morning Guardian Knight of the Port. Hope you slept well. You can call on us anytime if you need a word.,5850
Theseus,Hi there Unicorn. Do you mind if I take little Yuni on a tour de dessert again? Huh? What is it? Did I say something odd?,5850
Theseus,They say to strike while the iron is hot but I'd say strike even if it's not. What I'm driving at is: let's take a break and clean the office shall we?,5851
Theseus,I'm here and listening if you need someone to talk to,5851
Theseus,Whoa! What's gotten into you?,5852
Theseus,Heehee. These are more rewards than you can shake a stick at. How lovely.,5852
Theseus,Oh this letter is addressed to you. I just assumed it was for me since it arrived by homing pigeon.,5853
Theseus,Splendid work our Eagle of Victory. Before you go reflect on your performance shouldn't we celebrate this triumph first?,5853
Theseus,Eyes open for my newfound strength!,5854
Theseus,The battle is on. Everyone stick close to me!,5854
Theseus,Eyes open for my might! Taaake THIS!,5855
Theseus,I will not succumb so easily!,5855
Theseus,Don't cross that delicate line Villainous Fiend – or else I'll do everyone a favour and eradicate you.,5856
Theseus,Care to join me? The woods are the perfect place for a tea party Picnic? Hmm I suppose it is more like a picnic now that you say that,5856
Theseus,How's your evening our Champion? Not too much work? Not feeling burnt out? Heehee. Do give me a call if you need anything. I'll do everything I can and still consider the things I can't do.,5857
Theseus,Eyes open for my marvellous Heehee oh it's nothing important. I simply used an incantation that tells me whenever you're in a spot. Saves you the effort of having to tell me. Convenient no?,5857
Theseus,I understand. You've given me the ring but aren't sure how to profess your love. I'll do the honour just Oh you worked up the courage? W-well that's good! Heehee. Did I do a good job?,5858
Theseus,Good morning my Honourable Knight. May luck be on our side today. Heehee.,5858
Theseus,Hey Perseus! Are you in the mood for another tea party with Unicorn? Those biscuits we had last time were simply divine!,5859
Theseus,A swim in the river in the woods? Sounds good! I'll pack my tea set biscuits and Hang on. This sounds an awful lot like a picnic to me,5859
Theseus,Need something? Heehee that's my cue. Eyes open now!,5860
Theseus,Welcome back our Seagull of Victory. You've fought admirably. Do you want a pat on the head? Or should I recite an incantation that'll take you straight to dreamland?,5860
Theseus,The commission team is back in port. I'm going make like a Sakura cat and beckon them to I've got it wrong?,5861
Theseus,You're meant to have yum cha tea with these manjuus? Sounds questionable These buns are a far cry from biscuits at a tea party.,5861
Theseus,Unicorn you and I have quite different outfits. See this is an Empery-style dress. The wings make me look a bit like a swan. Heehee.,5862
Theseus,Oh wow *blushes*,5862
Theseus,The commission team is back. I have some carp ornaments on hand so Yeah let's go hand out some gifts!,5863
Ticonderoga,Oh my you don't look that great How about I do something special for you? What you ask? Hehe why don't you try imagining what it might be?,5863
Ticonderoga,What's on the moon you wonder? A rabbit? Aliens? Hehe. Whatever it is I'd like to see it for myself one day.,5864
Ticonderoga,If you're tired you can snuggle up to me and rest for a bit. Oh would you rather have a lap pillow instead? Well if someone walks in on us I'll leave the explanations to you~ Hehe.,5864
Ticonderoga,My are you sure you want to be doing this? I think I saw Aoba or someone passing by with a camera earlier.,5865
Ticonderoga,You still haven't completed the new missions? Hmm Well it's fine for now. Just take care of them at your own pace.,5865
Ticonderoga,The commissions team is back. We should go and greet them right away.,5866
Ticonderoga,I've gotten even stronger Great!,5866
Ticonderoga,Stick to the plan!,5867
Ticonderoga,Where did we go wrong,5867
Ticonderoga,Let's show off the fruits of our labor!,5868
Ticonderoga,Hard to port! Watch out for fire!,5868
Ticonderoga,There are many excellent allies here at the port. I I'll have to work hard won't I~,5869
Ticonderoga,I'm not particularly noteworthy as a warship and it might be a while until I can truly stand by your side as your equal Even so are you really fine with me? Can I really stay at your side?,5869
Ticonderoga,Huh?! Uh umm What am I supposed to say in response to your proposal? Uhh You're really giving this to me? Ahh I'm sorry I'm just so happy that my heart is about to explode and I don't know what to do and ahh,5870
Ticonderoga,"It's Valentine's Day so let's do ""something"" to give you a little bit of motivation heehee~ Now close your eyes relax and slowly open your mouth. The chocolate on my fingertips is sweet isn't it~?",5870
Ticonderoga,Here's the chocolate you've been waiting for Question is how do you want to receive it? Tell me and I'll give it my best shot. You want it with a kiss? Yeah I can do that! Alright start by y'know closing your eyes.,5871
Ticonderoga,I love going stargazing with Intrepid. Really it's surprising how much our interests align.,5871
Ticonderoga,Are you down in the dumps? Well how about I cheer you up with a little show? A magic trick perhaps?,5872
Ticonderoga,No matter how many times I practice when it comes time for the performance I can't help but get nervous Maybe I'm not really cut out for this,5872
Ticonderoga,Next up the Essex's air show! Feast your eyes on the performance!,5873
Ticonderoga,I hope you'll all come back for more! Hehe just kidding~,5873
Ticonderoga,I guess we didn't rehearse enough,5874
Ting_An,Akashi has a monopoly on this port's commerce and she seems to have some unscrupulous dealings every now and then. Now if I could muscle my way into– Hmm? These are the regulations? Boo,5874
Ting_An,Pay close attention to your checkbook and remember that a penny saved is a penny earned. Hmm? There are too many people here who always want it all? Ahaha how awfully capricious of them,5875
Ting_An,Were you planning to upgrade the equipment in your office any time soon? If so would you mind letting me take care of it? I'll be sure to meet all your needs at the lowest budget.,5875
Ting_An,What about my outfit? Oh hmm I suppose they are rather breezy,5876
Ting_An,Jeez If you keep this up I won't give you any more advice,5876
Ting_An,The mission rewards have arrived. Heehee now how should we use them to turn a greater profit?,5877
Ting_An,Well done on your sortie. During your absence I took it upon myself to seek out the items in need of restocking discussed earlier Please take a look at the details here.,5877
Ting_An,A commission has been completed. It seems we've gotten some equipment in addition to the regular awards. Hmm let me appraise it to see how much it's worth,5878
Ting_An,Fight to your heart's content. I shall watch your backs everyone.,5878
Ting_An,Another sailing route made safe. Hmm maybe I can use this opportunity to establish a new trade route?,5879
Ting_An,Hmm I must say these losses are rather severe,5879
Ting_An,It's time to close up shop!,5880
Ting_An,Hmm With this I might have to consider some higher-risk options,5880
Ting_An,As the old saying goes time reveals the character of one's true heart. No matter how well you wear your disguise you will be seen through sooner or later.,5881
Ting_An,Are any of your friends interested in some of the Dragon Empery's collectibles? If so I'd appreciate it if you could introduce them to me~,5881
Ting_An,This is my present to you as thanks for helping me out a while ago. Go ahead and take it – there's no need to be polite. It's not like I'm planning anything in particular; I just wanted to return the favor that's all. Everything here is pretty mundane stuff helpful in your daily work so there's nothing for you to worry about.,5882
Ting_An,When it comes to relationships you can't deal in profits and losses or expect returns on your investments. I'm sure you thought carefully before deciding to give this to me Yes I understand. And my answer to you is I accept. Allow me to repay your feelings with my eternal devotion~,5882
Ting_An,Oh do you remember the statement I gave you earlier? Some new ideas suddenly dawned upon me Since nothing has been implemented yet shall we give it another pass?,5883
Ting_An,*pant* *pant* Phew. I didn't know that kneading dough took so much physical endurance Urgh I'm all sweaty now,5883
Ting_An,Why does this store have to make dough from scratch instead of using premade wrappers? Why is this sort of commitment necessary?,5884
Ting_An,For the last step I had Ning Hai and Ping Hai steam the baozi. Though I did learn a few things from watching them the amount of heat and length of cooking time still seem hard to master,5884
Ting_An,Hai Tien said she wanted some baozi stuffed entirely with chilies But if Hwah Jah were to get her hands on one I'm sure that scene would be a total disaster,5885
Ting_An,Oh right I heard that some Dragon Empery antiques arrived at Akashi's shop. If you're worried about buying counterfeits I can come with you.,5885
Ting_An,Ugh now there's flour all over me,5886
Ting_An,Welcome back. Take these presents as a token of my appreciation for helping me out. Please I don't want to feel like I'm always in your debt.,5886
Tirpitz,Once you get used to waiting you lose sight of what you were waiting for.,5887
Tirpitz,Big sister Now that you mention it I think I might actually have one Ah I've already started to forget.,5887
Tirpitz,Strategic reasons? I was installed with cannons but they were never meant to be fired. Ironic isn't it?,5888
Tirpitz,Are you cold?,5888
Tirpitz,I'll think of how to deal with you later.,5889
Tirpitz,Finish your missions properly. Perhaps you will one day realize the joy of having any purpose at all.,5889
Tirpitz,Mission rewards how nice.,5890
Tirpitz,More mail for you Ah I'm envious.,5890
Tirpitz,The commission seems to be complete Next time why don't you let me go? I'm a little curious.,5891
Tirpitz,If you have no opponents all the might in the world is meaningless.,5891
Tirpitz,So this is the taste of victory.,5892
Tirpitz,So this is the frustration that comes from failure and fear.,5892
Tirpitz,Checkmate.,5893
Tirpitz,No one would protect those who asked for their own destruction.,5893
Tirpitz,In the end are you just another incompetent fool unable to command me?,5894
Tirpitz,I have already grown used to the cold solitude of the North. At this point it's natural for me to have no expectations.,5894
Tirpitz,Those who have nothing to lose also have nothing to fear But is this kind of bravery really anything to be proud of?,5895
Tirpitz,Ahh I see. I thought I was used to the cold and embraced it but that was just because I had forgotten the joy of human interaction and the warmth of being with someone But now I remember,5895
Tirpitz,Happy Valentine's Day. My blessings to you and my sister. I've always got your back and so does little Percival oh course. Hehehe.,5896
Tirpitz,Happy Valentine's. We all count on you and you never disappoint. This chocolate is my way of affirming that I will always be here helping you help others. Everyone has a place and I hope I can say that my uncontested place is right next to you.,5896
Tirpitz,Summer In the past it was always just a hot and stifling season But now? Doesn't my outfit tell the whole story? Let's get going there's bound to be a lot of people on the beach.,5897
Tirpitz,In the past I never saw summer as more than a hot and humid slog But now? My outfit probably says it all Let's go everyone's already waiting for us at the beach.,5897
Tirpitz,As long as you're by my side even looking off into the horizon is meaningful.,5898
Tirpitz,Some of my colleagues seem to mistake me for some unapproachable ice queen Perhaps playing beach volleyball with them would help,5898
Tirpitz,The sunset and the beach at night are wonderful views. When you're done with work want to accompany me for a walk along the shore?,5899
Tirpitz,Even though it's summer there are still some things you shouldn't do,5899
Tirpitz,Even I can't get fired up about doing missions during the summer because it's too hot,5900
Tirpitz,Truthfully I still have a hard time conversing with Bismarck But at least now time is on our side. There will be plenty of things for us to talk about in the future wouldn't you agree?,5900
Tirpitz,"In the past the word ""sister"" meant nothing to me. But the moment I laid eyes on her I knew in my heart Yes she is indeed my sister.",5901
Tirpitz,Behold she basks in everyone's adoring gaze as they orbit around her upon the resplendent firmament of the stage as if she is the center of the universe But you and I both know that is not where she wants to be.,5901
Tirpitz,Waiting for her to find us instead of taking the initiative to find her might be a bit of my nasty streak showing but I'm still the little sister here. I have that right don't I?,5902
Tirpitz,Do we have new missions? Don't worry Bismarck won't mind waiting a bit longer.,5902
Tirpitz,If she was here how would she have fought this battle?,5903
Tirpitz,They have a peculiar way of wishing a happy New Year in the Sakura Empire. In line with their traditions I've put on this new outfit. I hope it doesn't look strange on me. You like it? I see That being the case I'll keep wearing it for the tim,5903
Tirpitz,Alabama proposed playing a type of badminton enjoyed around New Year's. I suppose that could be fun. The loser will have ink rubbed on their face? On second thought I will pass.,5904
Tirpitz,It feels warm A nice change of pace.,5904
Tirpitz,*sigh* Could you please mind your manners in public?,5905
Tirpitz,It's all right I just got here myself. I will say it's strangely reassuring to know I'm not the only one nervous on this day.,5905
Tosa,"I hate the phrase ""it's how it's always been done."" The same mistakes will forever be repeated as long as fools keep spouting it.",5906
Tosa,Brute force – the most primitive but also most effective approach. That said I much prefer fighting with words over swords.,5906
Tosa,I do not shy away from using any trick required to achieve my goals. I would rather that than play by the rules and end up at the bottom of the sea.,5907
Tosa,Stay behind if you cannot fight. The weak should know their place from the strong – this is the belief my sister holds.,5907
Tosa,I am neither as forward-thinking as Amagi nor as short-fused as my sister. What? What's incorrect? The part about my sister or my description of myself?,5908
Tosa,Seeing as you have time to kill why not practice your swordplay with me?,5908
Tosa,Acting on a momentary impulse can have deadly repercussions. I do hope you're not getting any outlandish ideas.,5909
Tosa,A mission has been completed has it? Then don't loiter around go and claim the rewards at once.,5909
Tosa,A letter eh? I would be grateful if even a third of the information in it is credible.,5910
Tosa,Did you see anything extraordinary on your expedition? You may find it inconsequential but I am curious to know what you encountered.,5910
Tosa,You don't expect me to announce when a commission team returns do you?,5911
Tosa,Hah my rampage is soon to begin!,5911
Tosa,It's over already? Hmph I expected more from them.,5912
Tosa,Gah so even I overestimate my abilities at times,5912
Tosa,Bear witness to who reigns supreme!,5913
Tosa,Hahaha Battles fraught with suspense are always the most interesting!,5913
Tosa,Weaklings belong behind the shorelines. I have no business with someone who cannot handle even a tidal wave.,5914
Tosa,You are brave lowering your guard around someone that could take your life at any moment. You say it's because you trust me? Hahahah. Trust. A fine word that is.,5914
Tosa,You are an odd one remaining unfazed in the presence of the Sakura Empire's ships. Still I do enjoy exchanging stories with you. What have you in store for me today?,5915
Tosa,Your ambitions and dreams are of no concern to me but I know that you need me. Which I admit is also true in reverse. Our fates are intertwined and we cannot afford to lose one another Hahahah isn't that right?,5915
Tosa,Simply being given life in this world would've been enough for me but now I've even been given a partner to spend said life with Hmph life is a long and arduous road and I am happy that I get to walk it with you.,5916
Tosa,You want Valentine's chocolates from me do you? You don't care about potential retaliation from Kaga? Very well. As long as you're aware of the consequences.,5916
Tosa,It struck me that this was Kaga's and I's first time making something together. I want you to have this chocolate and deduce whether it's from my batch or hers. You have no way of knowing? That's exactly the point – this way she can neither brag nor grumble over whose chocolate you ate first.,5917
Tosa,You look tired from all the commotion and girls chasing you. Very well; I will shelter you and treat you to something sweet. Oh I'm not sure you should be thanking me You may have found yourself in the clutches of someone even more terrifying.,5917
Tosa,All right hurry up and get to work. I'll find something to do.,5918
Tosa,As ships our purpose is to connect the hearts of mankind as well as the ocean's routes. No matter what shape we might take that will always hold true. Even if we were born for the sake of war that will always hold true.,5918
Tosa,Privacy? As someone who is strong isn't it only natural to protect someone who is weak such as you wherever and whenever?,5919
Tosa,You want to cross swords with me? We could but It would be a dull match if I don't go all-out but then you are bound to suffer grave injuries Hmm what to do,5919
Tosa,Do not let your hand waver. Be more bold if you so wish. Hahaha!,5920
Tosa,Missions? Let me see them.,5920
Tosa,Oh was that the mission completion notification? How was the payment?,5921
Tosa,Mail? If it's a reassignment request I'd just rip it up.,5921
Tosa,Why don't you tell me about something interesting that happened out there? I like hearing about that stuff.,5922
Tosa,A commission team has returned. It would seem I've grown used to announcing this.,5922
Tosa,Lest you forget no matter how great your ambitions may be you are but a vulnerable human. If you are ever in danger you must take cover and protect yourself. If misfortune befalling you strips me of my reason to move forward I will hunt you down through the depths of hell or the pinnacles of heaven. Don't think you can escape from me ahahaha!,5923
Tosa,An inspection? You're awfully gung-ho about your work considering how hot it is outside Surely you wouldn't have some sort of ulterior motive?,5923
Tosa,Whew It's nice to get to play freely but I must take heed of all the extra attention this swimsuit draws to me,5924
Tosa,You should avoid swimming too much as you're so sickly Amagi. How tragic it is a ship such as you being so frail,5924
Tosa,The shrine maiden and her sister frolicking in the water A rare sight to be had.,5925
Tosa,We could play a round of go if you are bored. I want a new opponent after playing against only my sister for so long.,5925
Tosa,You're in need of a snack? Sorry I only just got these from my sister. That said we could exchange side dishes I suppose,5926
Tosa,Try this with my sister instead. Actually don't; it would likely backfire on you,5926
Tosa,My sister is still on the way here? Hmph then I will prepare you some food.,5927
Trento,You've already finished all the paperwork? That's great~!,5927
Trento,Tea blends let's see Hmm would any Royal girls take issue with this mix? Yeah they might,5928
Trento,Looks like I'll get to enjoy both the Dragon Empery's AND the Sakura Empire's cuisine at this port~ That's wonderful~,5928
Trento,If we push on just a little more we can take on a new mission!,5929
Trento,Please don't forget to check your new mail!,5929
Trento,The commission team is back safe and sound. May I head out to receive them?,5930
Trento,Please take good care of the others as well okay?,5930
Trento,Come on everyone! We are born winners!,5931
Trento,Very well done everyone! I'm so glad we won~!,5931
Trento,It's okay it's okay! This isn't anybody's fault!,5932
Trento,Let's go everyone!,5932
Trento,This doesn't look very promising,5933
Trento,I much prefer complimenting and congratulating people over scolding and blaming them~,5933
Trento,Please have some of this stamina-recovering coffee!  Oh does it taste bad? Let me try Eww?! I might have mistook salt for sugar,5934
Trento,Are you having troubles of any kind? Could you share them with me? Telling others what's on your mind can be a great help~,5934
Trento,Whew Okay let me show you how it's done. You just mix it in with the cream like this. Now open your mouth please Hehe well done! Now it's your turn to feed me~,5935
Trento,You've already finished all the paperwork? That's great~! Then I say we go have lunch with Trieste~,5935
Trento,Ah you're going for a stroll around the pier in a while? Do you want me to come with you?,5936
Trento,How about taking a little break and doing something fun? We can doodle with crayons play with toy blocks or maybe even do a round of musical chairs Hehehe~,5936
Trento,Okey-dokey let's cuddle all you want! Wait this isn't exactly what I had in mind,5937
Trento,You have new mail~ Just be careful not to fold the envelope okay?,5937
Trento,Awesome work bringing everyone back safe and sound~ Keep it up sweetie!,5938
Trento,The commission team has returned. Remember to check the rewards list!,5938
Trento,You've shown how much you need me so as promised I wholly accept you for who you are~ Hehehe~ You have nothing to worry about sweetie. You're doing really really good~,5939
Trento,If there's anything you want me to do just speak up~ Don't be shy~,5939
Trento,Being at the beach always makes people more easygoing I suppose I'll forgive you today~,5940
Trieste,Right on time. It's good to know you're punctual. Try to be here the same time tomorrow.,5940
Trieste,Why are you here and not in your office working? Shoo with you. You're still on duty.,5941
Trieste,I'll schedule the resupply shipment. Better I do it than trust an underachiever to produce good results.,5941
Trieste,You made an error in this paragraph. Fix it yourself – it's tiring enough just pointing out mistakes. Don't make me dump more assignments on you.,5942
Trieste,People put pineapple on pizza?! That's disgusting! That's a war crime against Sardegnian cuisine!,5942
Trieste,Need a break do you? Fair enough. I suggest doing some stretches.,5943
Trieste,Huh?!,5943
Trieste,Keep your nose to the grindstone. These missions won't finish themselves. Do a good job and I'll treat you to a home-cooked meal.,5944
Trieste,You've done well. Here you are as promised. It's a good thing I wrote that down.,5944
Trieste,Best to read your mail now before you forget about it.,5945
Trieste,I'll check through the after-action report. In the meantime reflect on your battle with the girls. Go on get to it.,5945
Trieste,The commission team has come back. Phew I'm glad they're okay.,5946
Trieste,A smart move on your part.,5946
Trieste,Everyone do your part or else I'm giving you detention!,5947
Trieste,This is all on me for being too damn lenient!,5947
Trieste,Keep an eye on your surroundings!,5948
Trieste,Well this is a conundrum,5948
Trieste,Are you happy now? Sigh I'm going to fix you. You WILL learn some damn discipline.,5949
Trieste,Done with your job? Okay. Have a nice dinner then treat yourself to a bath. You'll feel as good as new after a hard day's work trust me.,5949
Trieste,That sortie sure took its toll on you. You should probably take some time to rest. Rework today's timetable as needed and I'll relay the changes to the others Huh? You want me to rest with you?,5950
Trieste,I don't need to rest though. Why do you want me to stick around? I suppose I could monitor to ensure you are getting enough rest Okay hang on I'll be there in a moment!,5950
Trieste,I figured you were dying to tell me something Huh? Did you arrange all this to propose to me? You're sure this isn't some mistake? S-s-so this ring is for ME?! Have you had these feelings for me all along? That makes me so happy! I just,5951
Trieste,Finished your morning preparations? I sure hope so. Please don't make the others shoulder your burdens.,5951
Trieste,I'm fine with giving you a lap pillow but I won't pamper you like Trento does Y-you meant I'D rest on YOUR lap? Well I suppose I No never mind! Come on here you go!,5952
Trieste,This paragraph is error-free it seems. Nicely done. It's things like this which prove that you're capable of running this place.,5952
Trieste,Since you'll be spectating tomorrow's exercise is there something you'd like for a boxed lunch? Let me know before the end of today.,5953
Trieste,Do I need a hand? Not at all I'm plenty capable of handling this.,5953
Trieste,Pick a mission to do first then set out to complete it. Do a good job and I'll Hmm well I'll set aside a day for a date with you.,5954
Trieste,Well well You did it. So how about that date? I did say I would didn't I?,5954
Trieste,The girls are waiting for you. This isn't the time to chit-chat with me – go talk to them. Yes of course I'll spend some quality time with you later.,5955
Trieste,You've got food on your face. I thought you could at least eat properly but I suppose you're a child hmm? Remember to drink your water too Clean it with a kiss? I-I suppose I could,5955
Trieste,Oh my are you done with your errands already? Surely you didn't skip work just to eat lunch with Ah sorry for doubting you. Alright let's go. Trento is waiting for us.,5956
Trieste,I don't know how to approach you when I wear this uniform. Do I treat you as an upperclassman? Should I address you differently or like normal?,5956
Trieste,What's for lunch today? You'll have to see for yourself. I'll tell you this: it's a dish both you and Trento like.,5957
Trieste,You're THAT eager to have lunch with me? What am I to do with you,5957
Trieste,Yup I really don't know how to approach you,5958
Trieste,Don't neglect your missions. You're keeping me and Trento waiting.,5958
Trieste,I think the commission team is back. Down there – isn't that them?,5959
Trieste,I know I'm strict with you I just want to say thank you. Like Veneto always says it's a good time to be frank with people when you're bathing with them.,5959
Trieste,Didn't I tell you to focus on relaxing today? Come into the water – your work can wait. Whew That's more like it.,5960
Trieste,Excited about dinner after this bath? So am I. I'll very eager to see what sort of food they serve here.,5960
Trieste,Whew This cool breeze is just what I needed.,5961
Trieste,In a bit Okay. Missions first then I'll go back in.,5961
Trieste,Can't you ask someone else to get the mission rewards? Or would you rather do it yourself first and continue your bath later?,5962
Trieste,You've received a letter. Better check it after this bath.,5962
Trieste,Don't let yourself get cold. Keep your shoulders below the water. There that's great D-did I sound like Trento just now?,5963
Trieste,Is the commission team bathing after us? Hmm I can't quite remember,5963
Trieste,The sea breeze is so refreshing Thank goodness.,5964
Trieste,Oh no My head's going completely blank,5964
Trieste,Ugh I'm sorry for making you worry when this was supposed to be a relaxing vacation for you Can I make it up to you somehow? We're alone out here so you can fawn on me all you want Y-yeah well Trento lets you do it all the time!,5965
U-1206,The manual for this industrial-grade AC says Hmm. Let's just skip to pushing this big red button Oh no what's happening?! How do I turn it off?!,5965
U-1206,Can I push this button? No? What about this one? Also no? Laaame,5966
U-1206,Oh someone's at the door! Hello? Who is it? Huh? There's nobody here? Maybe I was just hearing things,5966
U-1206,Your documents are printed and good to go! The cover and back are swapped around? Oops uh I'll go look for the manual,5967
U-1206,Huh? Are you having dirty thoughts right now?,5967
U-1206,There's no button on my forehead so stop that!,5968
U-1206,Oh geez so many missions I'll help you with them so we have more time to play later! Let's go!,5968
U-1206,I heard you finished a mission! That means more time for us to hang out right? Hehehe~,5969

U-1206,The commission team is back! I'll go say hi!,5970
U-1206,My intuition just got keener!,5970
U-1206,Now's my time to shine!,5971
U-1206,We did it! Wait shouldn't I get some sort of prize for being the MVP?,5971
U-1206,Oh fudge! I'm gonna push the emergency resurface button! They're not watching me are they?!,5972
U-1206,Fire torpedoes! Oops wrong button! There!,5972
U-1206,Ow ow ow! Stop hitting me!,5973
U-1206,You'll have to become a saint if you want my forgiveness! To start with Lemme think Okay first of all you've gotta get on everyone's good side.,5973
U-1206,I don't understand this instruction manual! But that's okay I'll just go with my gut until I figure it out!,5974
U-1206,Remember how you said we'd do something together next time you're free? You don't? Hrmph You definitely did though! Whatever we're doing it now! We're going surfing!,5974
U-1206,Hehehe~ I'm so happy right now I can't even think straight! I could just fall right into your arms! You make me feel like the happiest girl in the world! Hehehehe~,5975
U-1206,Okay so I'm meant to press this blue button instead of the red one on the AC Achoo! Aww dang it I pressed the red one without even thinking about it!,5975
U-1206,I've got an idea! Hehehe lemme just push this button There we go! Fan's on now! Enjoy that cool air!,5976
U-1206,Your documents are printed and good to go! I made sure to read the instructions this time! Agh the text is on both sides of the paper! How'd this happen?!,5976
U-1206,It's always you touching me! Let me touch you for once!,5977
U-1206,Hehehe~ Don't be shy~,5977
U-1206,Hehehe I like this!,5978
U-1206,You've got new mail! I'll open it for y– Phew. I nearly did it again Here you are! Your unopened mail!,5978
U-1206,Open sesame! Kidding~ I'll just open the door like normal for you!,5979
U-1206,Is this a soda fountain? Guess I just press the button to make drinks come out! Clickity! Oh shoot! I forgot to put a cup down first!,5979
U-1206,Elbe! Need a hand with serving all these drinks? I'll help!,5980
U-1206,We're offering a special deal: one-on-one chat time with a maid! Completely free of charge!,5980
U-1206,The service button? Sure I'll press it right– Wait I'm dumb! That means a customer's calling for me!,5981
U-1206,I hope you're not trying to ogle me like a perv!,5981
U-1206,It's NOT okay to wanna do p-pervy stuff to maids!,5982
U-1206,Hehehe~ Wouldn't you say I deserve a tip for my top-tier service?,5982
U-1206,The commission girls are back in port! I'll start prepping some drinks!,5983
U-37,Oh hey! I'm going out so call if ya need somethin'! Gonna go for a dive!,5983
U-37,My rigging's got bits that'll hurt ya so watch yourself if ya wanna feel it.,5984
U-37,Can't I get a free pass if just say the paperwork's up and vanished? No? Figures.,5984
U-37,They say teamwork makes the dream work! So let's round up some more peeps to do this paperwork!,5985
U-37,Touch my tail without warning and I'll whip your ass with the tail end of my rigging! Hey I'm kidding! Hahahahah!,5985
U-37,How d'ya like my glossy wet skin~?,5986
U-37,New mission huh? I'm on it! What? We're not disruptin' cargo lanes?,5986
U-37,Mission's been completed! Guess I didn't have much to do with it though Lame.,5987
U-37,Look at that new mail! Wonder if it's from across the pond.,5987
U-37,Commission team's back? I'll go greet 'em! Better that than be bored to death in this office!,5988
U-37,Now that's a nice boost to my swimming skills!,5988
U-37,Wanna hazard a guess where I'll appear from~?,5989
U-37,We are so throwin' a party when we get back!,5989
U-37,Well damn. Better luck next hunt huh,5990
U-37,You ain't gettin' through me!,5990
U-37,Oh crap! Might be time to dive back down and hide,5991
U-37,Miss me with your lame ass! Laterrr!,5991
U-37,So here's the dorm here's the academy and here's the office Gotcha. Now I've got a pretty good idea of where everything is!,5992
U-37,Check out my massive rigging it's big enough for two people! Hop on and I'll take ya some place far away!,5992
U-37,When ya go on missions in remote oceans ya gotta live with being alone for days in a row But I've got this photo of you in your sleep to help stave off the loneliness! Heheh~,5993
U-37,Sometimes I just wanna be right beside you sometimes I just wanna hide and watch ya struggle to find me. Y'know I think I'm in love! You made me feel this way and you'll own up to it won'tcha? Hehehe~,5993
U-37,(You found U-37 asleep under your desk clutching a box of chocolates with your name on it. She probably wanted to jump out and surprise you. Later once she woke up you decided to act surprised so she wouldn't get all flustered.),5994
U-37,I've wanted to give ya my chocolate all this time but couldn't. So I waited and waited and waited my ass sore for Valentine's to come 'round again – and now it's here and here I am! Surprised ya didn't I? No? Well whatever! Here ya go at any rate! ,5994
U-37,I read that if you really want a smooth chocolate delivery with major impact and surprise factor setting is key. So bam – banging seaside under a banging night sky! Wooo I knocked this one outta the park! I can tell 'cause you're simply speechless!,5995
U-37,Now then my dear visitor I would like to play for you a little song Heheh go figure I'm good at this whole mimicry thing!,5995
U-37,These clothes keep slippin' off Annoying for me but just the way you like it am I right~? Heheh~,5996
U-37,"My U-boat buds agreed to play this thing called ""hanetsuki""! U-110 sure seems excited about it Hang on can I even play in these tight clothes?",5996
U-37,An electric guitar would really be more my style y'know? Would kinda clash with this getup though. Ahah.,5997
U-37,Hehehe~ I've got pretty slick skin if I do say so myself.,5997
U-37,Playing music's a way for you to express your feelings I uh might still only be able to play beginner songs but you feel the emotion in 'em right?,5998
U-37,Oh you're back. Ready to start chipping away at this mountain of paperwork?,5998
U-37,Sauerkraut juice is a great pick-me-up. Give it a try and see for yourself.,5999
U-37,Penelope? Oh right she works here too. Take good care of her you hear?,5999
U-37,You can't figure out what that report says? Let me see What I'm too close to you? Hmm Well my bad~,6000
U-37,Just give me the signal when you wanna slack off. Hehehe~,6000
U-37,"Are you saying you find my body ""too good to pass up?",6001
U-37,Do you find it thrilling to put off your missions until the last minute?,6001
U-37,Accomplishing a mission can be the reward in and of itself. Receiving tangible things is a nice bonus though.,6002
U-37,Letting your mail pile up just to read through it all at once might feel rewarding but it's not very productive.,6002
U-37,Haste makes waste. Take it easy yeah?,6003
U-37,The commission team has come back in one piece. That's nice to see.,6003
U-37,Bolstering your combat abilities is always a good move.,6004
U-37,There's nothing to worry about. Just take it easy.,6004
U-37,You'll need to do better than that my surface ship friends.,6005
U-37,There's no turning this battle around We should probably retreat.,6005
U-37,Watch your back~,6006
U-37,No more playing nice!,6006
U-37,I just don't know what to do with inconsiderate jerks like you.,6007
U-37,A submarine must be slippery elusive. You know an unknown threat lurking beneath the surface. Hehehe,6007
U-37,I've got someone on the hook. What do I mean by that? You'll have to wait to find out. That's part of what being patient is about.,6008
U-37,Ooh I see you've been preparing something of your own. So have you made your mind? You'll live the rest of your days happily with me? Great then we're all set,6008
U-37,A web of social complexity surrounds Valentine's chocolate. You might think you got it out of obligation when in actuality the person who gave it cares deeply about you. Can you work out which category mine falls into? Hehehe~,6009
U-37,Ah Valentine's Day. A special day indeed. Do you know what that means? That my chocolate for you too is special Oh please it doesn't mean anything in particular. Don't think too hard about it.,6009
U-37,What feelings are behind the chocolate you get on Valentine's? Is it really love or are you overanalyzing things? You can never be sure. What you CAN be sure of is that my chocolate DOES have feelings behind it. So given that information,6010
U-37,Happy Lunar New Year. Have you cooked up a scheme for this year's festival? Hehehe~ I'm of course talking about giving out New Year's gifts and hanging up decorations. I've devised a master plan of my own.,6010
U-37,While there's no huge stack of paperwork awaiting you there's no shortage of other things we need to do.,6011
U-37,Can't think of a good present? Hmm. Might I suggest a handwritten letter? I think that gets your feelings across pretty well.,6011
U-37,We were playing hide-and-seek earlier and get this: U-81 hid herself inside a snowman. That girl is on a completely different level.,6012
U-37,I wonder what Penelope's up to I might just go and check.,6012
U-37,Is this your idea of a New Year's gift?,6013
U-37,Whoa there. A little too excited from all the festivities aren't we?,6013
U-37,Take it nice and easy. No point stressing out on a holiday.,6014
U-47,Oh. You're back.,6014
U-47,Are you sending me out? I can handle it by myself.,6015
U-47,Enemies nearby? Welp,6015
U-47,If you need someone to patrol I'm good to go anytime.,6016
U-47,Such a quiet office I approve.,6016
U-47,Inspecting my equipment?,6017
U-47,You looking to take a nap at the bottom of Scapa Flow?,6017
U-47,There's another mission,6018
U-47,Rewards are in You don't want to see them?,6018
U-47,So many people here now It's so loud,6019
U-47,Looks like the commission team is back There's a lot of them. I don't want to go,6019
U-47,Enhancing sounds good.,6020
U-47,This is where you'll all sleep!,6020
U-47,That's how it goes.,6021
U-47,So this is how it ends,6021
U-47,You can't be serious.,6022
U-47,Give me some space.,6022
U-47,Your office is very quiet. I like it here.,6023
U-47,So like I can't really help with your work at all But you'll let me stay here You don't mind?,6023
U-47,I can visit anytime I want? Thanks But For some reason I feel like I can't really relax here I'm always on edge,6024
U-47,I'm meant for more than just voyaging through the cold dark oceans. My place is here at the port by your side When I'm with you even just sitting in silence I feel happy.,6024
U-47,Ah I left the chocolate on your desk. It's going to get crowded in here soon so I'm leaving. When everyone's gone I'll come back.,6025
U-47,I'm a bit late sorry about that. It was hard finding a moment where it's just the two of us. I've got this Valentine's chocolate for you. It's weird now that I've finally managed to give you the chocolate I don't feel like I've achieved something special,6025
U-47,"Whew This looks like a decent place to give you my chocolate. Nobody'll see us here. Not 'cause the location really matters I just needed the extra time to digest these weird urges to say ""I love you"" and stuff. Already had to muster my courage just to give you this in the first place you know",6026
U-47,Ah you're here. Me? Pretty much the same. I just got back.,6026
U-47,Nearsighted? No there are no lenses in them.,6027
U-47,If you're thirsty You can have half.,6027
U-47,My outfit? My friends picked it out for me. I don't usually think about that stuff,6028
U-47,I don't know my way around on land so You're my guide.,6028
U-47,How about I take you on a trip to the bottom of the sea? It's really pretty down there too.,6029
U-47,Mail?  Is it that postcard we sent?,6029
U-47,Phew The view up here on land isn't as bad as I thought.,6030
U-47,Under the sea or up on land it doesn't really matter As long as you're with me it's beautiful.,6030
U-47,You found me. Of course.,6031
U-47,Another sortie? I'll be right out. It's fine I can go dressed like this.,6031
U-47,I'm a little more talkative now? Huh I just find I have more to talk about with you.,6032
U-47,The party? I wouldn't know what to do with myself out there.,6032
U-47,I'm always stuck with a bunch of noisy girls: U-73 U-81 U-101 But even though I like it quiet I really don't mind them that much.,6033
U-47,Here's to you for taking good care of me.,6033
U-47,Should I sober you up?,6034
U-47,They're looking for me? Tell them to stop worrying. I'm fine.,6034
U-47,It's nice to be left alone but the feeling I get when I'm with you it feels almost addictive.,6035
U-47,Welcome back Master You'd like to talk? About what?,6035
U-47,Why the outfit? It's our theme I guess. Isn't this what maids wear?,6036
U-47,If that's all then I'm off for another delivery. It's nice working solo.,6036
U-47,Hey um You okay Icarus? Sorry I didn't mean to scare you,6037
U-47,Here our phone number. Call us and we'll deliver to your office in 1 minute or less.,6037
U-47,This coffee is for the patrons. I'll brew some for you later.,6038
U-47,No more service from me today then.,6038
U-47,I see new delivery missions have come in.,6039
U-47,That's a lot of mission rewards.,6039
U-47,Is this an order? Oh it's just new mail for you.,6040
U-47,Check out the Iron Blood's shop when you're craving pastries. It's laid-back and comfy (Plus you'll get to see me),6040
U-47,Commission rewards huh Sorry can't fit those in my backpack.,6041
U-47,I'm done cleaning I guess.,6041
U-47,Need to hurry back!,6042
U-47,Wanna hang after my shift's over? I'm thinking we could uhh go somewhere and unwind. Dunno where yet Open for suggestions.,6042
U-47,"It is I U-47 servant of the Mistress"" Okay that's pretty cringe to say out loud",6043
U-47,I'm so not cut out for the role of a vampire's servant. Chilling in a corner is more my thing,6043
U-47,U-73 why are you coming up to me with this weird potion? Garlic juice? Thing is I'm not a real vampire so,6044
U-47,I can help as long as it's nothing too crazy.,6044
U-47,You're just asking for a bite to the neck.,6045
U-47,Another mission just came in? Five more minutes then I'll do it.,6045
U-47,Rewards from a mission just arrived. Want me to have a look?,6046
U-47,The bats outside the window are screeching again Oh they've brought a letter.,6046
U-47,Our commission team is back. Go say hi to them for me. Oh and don't tell anyone I'm here.,6047
U-47,Hope this will end quietly again,6047
U-47,Better head home now before dawn breaks.,6048
U-47,Overextended huh Figures.,6048
U-47,I read this love story featuring a vampire and a human. It was actually pretty good. If you're free we could read it together.,6049
U-47,Lützow digs the kitchen. Me I'm content to just gather ingredients You doubt that? The kitchen's much more work than this.,6049
U-47,The Four Unbreakables are making something? Like food? If not that then what?,6050
U-47,Couldn't catch a carp but Akashi's lightning-quick manjuu team caught tons of other fish we can have tonight Am I miffed? Not really.,6050
U-47,You want a closer look? One sec Huh? You didn't mean the fish?,6051
U-47,Woah! (U-47 got pulled back the moment before you could touch her.) Oh s-sorry. I promise I wasn't trying to get away.,6051
U-47,So rewards. Can I take some? Lots of stuff there the banquet won't use up everything.,6052
U-47,There you are. Heehee I heard you're meant to take it real easy today. Hope we can do that together,6052
U-47,Going underwa– Hey stop pulling!,6053
U-47,A happy victory for a happy new year I guess.,6053
U-522,This tail connector's not just for show. When plugged into my rigging: bam gives me perfect control.,6054
U-522,When I'm fighting you can stare at me to your heart's content y'know? Hehehe~,6054
U-522,I just LOVE seeing my enemies squirming about trying to get away from my attacks~ Ahahahah~!,6055
U-522,You feelin' like some hide and seek? I'm game. I always win y'see.,6055
U-522,Ya figure we got any new missions possibly involving hunting?,6056
U-522,Mumph Oh you're back? Want some corned beef?,6056
U-522,Commission team's back safe and sound~ Let's go check out those rewards.,6057
U-522,Sehr gut!,6057
U-522,Oh boy here we go! Listen up folks! It's lunchtime!,6058
U-522,That's all? Laaaame. I wanna have more fun~,6058
U-522,Oopsie Guess I messed up a calculation,6059
U-522,Victory blitz!,6059
U-522,You're not half-bad,6060
U-522,You want a fun hunt ya need good chums else it's not happening~,6060
U-522,Hey you're pretty chill~ I'm feelin' like this is the start of a good relationship~,6061
U-522,I think we oughta get to know each other more intimately~ Whaddya say Com-man-der? Ahahahah! Look at you blushing! Oh that's hilarious!,6061
U-522,So how do ya like my Valentine's chocolate? Belongs in the Chocolate Hall of Fame am I right? Heheh! But let me hear ya put it in your own words. Well?,6062
U-522,Just as you look forward to my chocolate I look forward to hearin' your impression of it. Oh and that nervous face you always make when I read you like an open book? I love that. Hahaha!,6062
U-522,How 'bout I pour ya some tea and you tell what ya like about my chocolate? Hit me with your honest immediate head-on opinion and I guarantee we'll both be red in the face by the end of this God just saying that out loud is makin' me blush!,6063
U-557,Pennies are said to bring good luck so I saved a bunch in my piggybank but that didn't seem to do much for me,6063
U-557,When you're a bad luck magnet you probably shouldn't get close to people. That way you won't cause them trouble,6064
U-557,I'll try to be the best secretary I can. It's the one thing I don't want to fail at,6064
U-557,Maybe this'll improve my luck too,6065
U-557,I hope I don't mess this up,6065
U-557,Sigh I'm used to it,6066
U-557,Let's hope these hit their target,6066
U-557,How unfortunate,6067
U-557,You wanna be friends with me? But I'm a bad luck magnet and that might be annoying for Nnh why are you patting me on the head all of a sudden,6067
U-557,My true feelings are the most important? I want to be of service to you because you're always so nice to me,6068
U-557,They say life has its ups and downs If that's true then eating this subpar chocolate should boost your luck later down the road Probably No definitely!,6068
U-557,I think I did a decent job with this year's chocolate. I poured my everything into it including the best of my cooking abilities and all my feelings for you. Try it and I'm sure you'll taste both.,6069
U-73,I'd rather be diving in the ocean and feeling the thrill of being near the enemy than stuck at port staring into space all day,6069
U-73,What is it? Got something I could help with? C'mon tell me something.,6070
U-73,With my support we could finish these missions with our eyes closed!,6070
U-73,Mail's just arrived~ Oh do you want me to read it on your behalf?,6071
U-73,Good to see you! Let me handle things for you while you get some rest~,6071
U-73,Commission complete! Great job everyone!,6072
U-73,Now my shots will be even more on point! Heh heh~,6072
U-73,The leader of wolfpacks that's me!,6073
U-73,Heheh! Did you see how strong I am?,6073
U-73,Oh nooo! Ahaha How the heck could we lose,6074
U-73,Wolfsrudeltaktik commence!,6074
U-73,Mein Leben! Better perform emergency maneuvers,6075
U-73,Uh My friends are waiting for me so sorry gotta scamper.,6075
U-73,Ahah I didn't think this would happen so fast but now you're a part of me! Relax just let me handle everything for you! I'll take care of you for the rest of your life~,6076
U-73,Underwater speed star and new (tentative) member of the Research Division I U-73 am here to deliver you my Valentine's chocolate! Here you go! Now you'll know just how good I am at cooking!,6076
U-73,Say are you curious to try this chocolate recipe the R&amp;D department came up with? Nice! Then let's put theory into practice. First: the ingredients. Next: chuck them in a pot bring to a boil What the–?! Smoke?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!,6077
U-73,Here! Valentine's chocolate for you! I did my best to stick to the science department's code of precision and accuracy until I finally created the perfect batch. The recipe is all-original too so I expect you'll love the taste~,6077
U-73,"I pored over the data and polished up my chocolate recipe. Then I realized ""Oh shoot only making it tastier isn't good enough!"" So three options One feed you it still solid between my lips; two feed you it melted between my lips; or three bake it into a cake and spoonfeed you. Which would you prefer?",6078
U-73,Now we raise the heat slightly then Oh God! I-it's on fire!,6078
U-73,Experiments necessitate preciseness. Being even one 100th of a milliliter off affects the result!,6079
U-73,The glamor of this lab coat drew me to the science room!  Huh? This ISN'T a lab coat? Aha ahahahaha,6079
U-73,You wanna be the target of my experimental fuel-powered torpedoes?,6080
U-73,Time for an experiment on you numskulls!,6080
U-73,You wanna learn the formula? Sure thing! First you mix the contents of these beakers then Wait are your hands shaking? Hahaha! Come on it'll be fine – I'm right here!,6081
U-73,Decided I'd try on this Dragon Empery dress in light of the season! Does it look good on me? Hehehe~,6081
U-73,And for the last step we raise the heat a few degrees. See brewing tea is like doing science – it takes precision.,6082
U-73,Might it be possible to make tea from a chemical concoction? Hmm It wouldn't really feel like tea if you made it that way So that's tricky,6082
U-73,You think I seem more ladylike than usual? Heh! That's exactly what I set out to do!,6083
U-73,You'd like a refill? Coming right up!,6083
U-73,"Seems you desire a ""special"" kind of concoction huh.",6084
U-73,Looks like I've found the ingredients for my concoction!,6084
Ulrich_von_Hutten,You're here. See that massive pile of paperwork on your desk? The two of us will be spending lots of quality time here until that's taken care of.,6085
Ulrich_von_Hutten,If you want peace of mind just don't bother worrying about anyone else. We may be born into this world but our keels and souls aren't at the mercy of others.,6085
Ulrich_von_Hutten,You want to know more about my rigging? Sure I can move it like I want to but there are times when it's pretty troublesome.,6086
Ulrich_von_Hutten,The Mysteries of the Port? Just leave it as it is. That's the only way it'll continue to keep your curiosity piqued isn't it.,6086
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Think for yourself Though you can't live selfishly you need to live for the sake of something you really desire. That way even if you die it won't be in vain.,6087
Ulrich_von_Hutten,It might be a surprise for you but I do have hobbies I enjoy. And it's not like I become a different person when I do.,6087
Ulrich_von_Hutten,If you've got something to say spit it out. I'll hear you out.,6088
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I'm not sure whether I should praise you or teach you your place,6088
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Hmph. You don't make any damn sense.,6089
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Missions huh? Whether we do them or not is up to you. That is your freedom.,6089
Ulrich_von_Hutten,The rewards have arrived. Kick back and enjoy the moment. You're going to miss out on it if you don't and all that'll be left is emptiness.,6090
Ulrich_von_Hutten,There's some mail. Looks like it contains confidential information I see.,6090
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Everyone made it back huh? Not bad.,6091
Ulrich_von_Hutten,The fleet's returned from their commissions. Hurry up and decide whether you or I go and greet them.,6091
Ulrich_von_Hutten,In order to create a peaceful world where power is not needed what you need is power. How paradoxical Oh don't mind me.,6092
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Tsk. This ammo is wasted on you lot!,6092
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Piss off weaklings. Just thinking about the amount of ammo I've wasted on you sorry lot makes me want to vomit.,6093
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I'll back off since we lost but don't count on it happening again.,6093
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Get lost you're in the way.,6094
Ulrich_von_Hutten,If you don't plan on dying here then focus up!,6094
Ulrich_von_Hutten,You sowed these seeds yourself. It's your mess to clean up not mine.,6095
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Trust is like a poison—once it enters your body it destroys you. The only way to protect yourself is to be wary of others.,6095
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Working for you is not the same as trusting you. The fact that you can command so many people Or rather be adored by so many means you of all people should understand.,6096
Ulrich_von_Hutten,You spineless fool who doesn't even know how to doubt others I've come to realize that you've spread deeper and deeper through me just like a poison. Tsk I'll return the favor mark my words.,6096
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I told you I'd return the favor. Yep I'll suck the poison out of you before it has a chance to spread throughout your body. This is my duty my responsibility for the person who did the same for me. But maybe I'm already too late? Hehehe,6097
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Embrace it drown in it Just as you put the curse of trust on me I'll place it on you. Trust Let the poison called affection consume you. Become just like me. Don't you know? You and I are already one.,6097
Ulrich_von_Hutten,What did you say? Valentine's chocolate? I didn't expect you of all to ask about such a thing For God's– Calm down. Yes of course I've made chocolate so don't lose your shit. I wouldn't even consider making this for anyone but you.,6098
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Tsk. Don't give me that look. I know what you want but I've not finished making it yet. Sit your ass down and be patient. I'll make you some damn hot cocoa to hold you over.,6098
Ulrich_von_Hutten,You finally showed up but you're not needed anymore. Hehehe. Don't just stand there in shock guess what I did for you.,6099
Ulrich_von_Hutten,What's wrong? Did something happen? You're not acting like yourself Trust in others like you trust in me that's how you'll put those girls at ease. Of course the same goes for me.,6099
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Even though you do so well when I pamper you you refuse to be pampered when you're not doing well Hmph. You're just like those little kitties in the most peculiar ways,6100
Ulrich_von_Hutten,If you're really dying to find out what's behind the Mysteries of the Port I won't stop you. I'll even accompany you. It'll be a good way of spending time with you.,6100
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Focus more on myself? It seems like you don't understand. It's because I'm focusing on myself that I do all these things for you.,6101
Ulrich_von_Hutten,When you neglect your health think about the people who would be sad if you collapsed. I for one don't want to feel sad.,6101
Ulrich_von_Hutten,This is how our relationship together is. I don't know why you're getting all flustered about it at this point,6102
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Do you want to find out which of us has less self-restraint?,6102
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Does being pampered like this irritate you?,6103
Ulrich_von_Hutten,There's a new mission. I did the parts I could help out with. I'll leave the rest to you.,6103
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Mission complete. Feeling a bit tired? Let's take a break until you've recovered enough energy.,6104
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Here's some mail for you. I broke the seals for you is that alright?,6104
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Are you alright? I don't doubt my ability to take care of my subordinates' safety but I can't help but worry about you Tell me are you really alright?,6105
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Looks like the fleet is back after their commissions. Don't you want to look at their beaming smiles?,6105
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I'll mow all of you down!,6106
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I want you to tell me whether you're satisfied with my performance or not.,6106
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I was able to bring everyone back safely.,6107
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Stay still. Don't wander away. I can't leave the one I absolutely adore alone. If someone actually tried to tear the two of us apart Hehehe Let's just say I'd tell them to eat shit.,6107
Ulrich_von_Hutten,*sigh* Do you really have to bother me during my break? It's a joke no need to take it so seriously. I was looking for someone to kill some time with anyway.,6108
Ulrich_von_Hutten,What's going on with you today? Spill it.,6108
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I really need to head back but the little'un just *sigh* what a pain in the ass.,6109
Ulrich_von_Hutten,The fan outside is so frickin' loud but I really need my alone time Huh? Who put these damn stickers here?,6109
Ulrich_von_Hutten,You already know what I'll do to people who start shit inside don't you? Yep. I'll give them their one warning.,6110
Ulrich_von_Hutten,I'm not really worried about Elbe causing trouble. Surprisingly she knows when to stop. Well at least she's not my main source of worry.,6110
Ulrich_von_Hutten,"Welcome back Master. May I take your order?"" You happy with that?",6111
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Tsk Again with that shit just 'cuz we're here? What a pain in the ass,6111
Ulrich_von_Hutten,The little'uns really like when you do this to them.,6112
Ulrich_von_Hutten,So you accept a mission and then immediately begin procrastinating? What a piece of work you are. Want me to do the same thing to you?,6112
Ulrich_von_Hutten,*Glug glug* Ahh that hits the spot. Tsk it's already empty Sorry mind grabbing me another can?,6113
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Looks like things worked out just fine.,6113
Ulrich_von_Hutten,Tsk they got me,6114
Umikaze,Please don't interrupt Yamakaze and Kawakaze's work Um if you want someone to play with use me instead,6114
Umikaze,I wonder if any seagulls will show up if we put some crumbs out by the window Ehehe,6115
Umikaze,The commission fleet seems to have brought back a lot of rewards. Shall I help you bring them in?,6115
Umikaze,Thank you for always looking after me!,6116
Umikaze,Fair winds good visibility Mhm!,6116
Umikaze,Ehehe It was only made possible by everyone else's hard work,6117
Umikaze,Don't worry about me More importantly are the others safe?,6117
Umikaze,I'll try to be helpful!,6118
Umikaze,I can hold on a bit longer!,6118
Umikaze,"Thanks to your help I've become a lot better at the touchy-feely stuff Um if it's not too much to ask could you continue to ""practice"" it with me?",6119
Umikaze,I was terribly conflicted this year. I went back and forth between feeling my handmade chocolate wouldn't be good enough but also disliking the idea of tying my feelings for you to a storebought item's price tag In the end I decided to make chocolate myself. Would you please be willing to accept it?,6119
Umikaze,Ah um it's alright! I'm already used to your touch!,6120
Umikaze,"Ermm Is this also a part of my training""?",6120
Umikaze,Ah um it's okay to do more of that head-patting thing,6121
Umikaze,Even one such as myself was able to obtain victory!,6121
Umikaze,Um The socks are on a bit tight,6122
Umikaze,I I'm not sure I can handle this kind of touching,6122
Umikaze,P-please don't bully me,6123
Umikaze,Wooow Look at all the seagulls gathering around that bread! They're so cute Wonder if I could pet them Ah! I-I'm sorry I was having a little too much fun,6123
Umikaze,I was so excited and busy planning last night that I didn't get much sleep. When I relax I get so sleepy No Umikaze you have to try harder Zzz,6124
Umikaze,C'mon Umikaze! You're brave enough to hold hands by now!,6124
Umikaze,Mission complete! Ehehe The seagulls seem happy too.,6125
Umikaze,If you're tired from walking we could take a break at that bench up there. Erm I took the liberty of bringing some light handmade foods,6125
Umikaze,The girls out on the commission are back. I'll join you in going to greet them!,6126
Umikaze,Did I manage to help? Thank goodness!,6126
Urakaze,So slow are you like a turtle who’s stumbled onto the battlefield?,6127
Urakaze,O you mean this family emblem? I designed this myself plus the clothes. I won’t accept any other comments except for “its cute”.,6127
Urakaze,That Hamakaze girl as my little sister she always acts superior to Tanikaze even more than I do darn,6128
Urakaze,If only we discovered Tusk then Kongou-sama would not sigh forget it what’s important is the present,6128
Urakaze,Official documents? Let me see hmm ahh I see I see,6129
Urakaze,This type of things should not be tolerated right? In that case die,6129
Urakaze,I’ve organized all the missions say what you want me to clear them as well?!,6130
Urakaze,The mission rewards have been confirmed I’ll leave the labor work of transporting it here to you.,6130
Urakaze,You’ve got mail hmm? You read it I didn’t really focus on what was written don’t mind me.,6131
Urakaze,You’ve worked hard today please get some rest.,6131
Urakaze,The commission fleet has returned did you forget?,6132
Urakaze,Thank you my ears are twitching? Impossible I’m not that happy at all.,6132
Urakaze,Muahaha all ships set sail!,6133
Urakaze,We won naturally what’s there to gloat about?,6133
Urakaze,Damn give me victory. Win or lose that’s the way of life in the Navy.,6134
Urakaze,The time has come!,6134
Urakaze,Such a tactical mistake,6135
Urakaze,Stay away from me stupidity is contagious.,6135
Urakaze,My fan? Its military issue not some ordinary fan. It’s used by Admirals so don’t underestimate me hehehe. Hmm? I said nothing.,6136
Urakaze,Hamakaze and Tanikaze are both so whimsical and wandering around. Those girls sure don’t have the temperment of being in the Navy. They still need to lean on me being their big sister. Such a headache,6136
Urakaze,Actually even though I don’t care that much and I have confidence in myself for the sake of asking do you think I’m independent enough?,6137
Urakaze,What I just asked offhandedly you sure are opinionated forget it. I’ll still listen to what you got to say. Just you wait one day I’ll impress you.,6137
Urakaze,Grace and service are the basics of any relationship. As ours is mutual I'm giving you chocolate to thank you for everything. In exchange you'll be happy for it. Fair deal?,6138
Urakaze,"Before you raise a fuss about it let me just tell you this - the concept of ""Christmas"" already existed during the Sengoku period so there's nothing weird about putting on a Christmas outfit!",6138
Urakaze,Merry Christmas. I suppose I'll let you take it easy today.,6139
Urakaze,You should know that I designed this outfit just by seeing the family crest here. Do you think it looks good?,6139
Urakaze,Isokaze stop frolicking around like a little kid and don't pull on me either! Ugh what am I going to do with you?,6140
Urakaze,I still have to prepare presents for the three stooges Jeez can't they be a bit more considerate towards their big sis normally? Oh well I suppose that's how it should be.,6140
Urakaze,It's snowing Hmm? It's not like I particularly want to play in the snow or anything but if you want to so badly I suppose I can tag along.,6141
Urakaze,Santa Claus?  Hmph I graduated from that fairy tale long ago.,6141
Urakaze,Another greeting card for you Curse you what a normie.,6142
Urakaze,Look here Christmas nowadays is a holiday that you celebrate with those who are important to you. You came here knowing that didn't you? Me? I don't particularly object,6142
Urakaze,Enough dilly-dallying! It's time to get on with today's rehearsal!,6143
Urakaze,"Of course they had music during the Sengoku period! But they didn't have rock bands? Listen it's called ""getting with the times.",6143
Urakaze,"Hamakaze said she won't join because it would ""impact her academic performance"" Hmph! She doesn't know what she's missing out on!",6144
Urakaze,A band logo? Yes and we'll use my family crest as the motif of course!,6144
Urakaze,"If you're going to rest find something durable to sit on I'm not ""showing concern"" just giving you instructions!",6145
Urakaze,Go on. Read the score and play the song like I taught you.,6145
Urakaze,Being a general is no excuse to skip out on rehears– Ahem! I mean missions.,6146
Urakaze,You've brought the missions rewards? Splendid Isokaze! I'll see to it you receive a castle for your efforts!,6146
Urakaze,Do we have any potential new band members? What? Nobody has even applied? Grrr I suppose there's no point in getting mad at you for it though,6147
Urakaze,What? Was I wrong? Hm It's been quite some time since Tanikaze said she'd go receive the commission team Hope nothing has happened to her,6147
Urakaze,Let us do like rock stars do and turn it up to eleven!,6148
Uranami,Could you give me the go-ahead to play now?,6148
Uranami,Whenever I ask Kinu if I can borrow her cute mask she just tells me no way in heck,6149
Uranami,Uranami rhymes with rural mommy. Doodle-loo nothing better to dooo.,6149
Uranami,Help friends in need defeat enemies with speed. That's my little motto.,6150
Uranami,When I tell folks about the things I like they all look super weirded out then they strangerzone me. But oh well.,6150
Uranami,One super serving of missions with a diet soda coming right up.,6151
Uranami,Whoosh here comes a letter. Aaaand there it is.,6151
Uranami,Welcome back tweety-doo. That's what a Manjuu would say. Yup-yup,6152
Uranami,The commission team's back. Oooh riiight you already knew that.,6152
Uranami,Done enhancy-pantsing yet? C'mawn I wanna play.,6153
Uranami,Blue skies blue sea daba-dee,6153
Uranami,I'm awesome Or so they say. But why?,6154
Uranami,Time to scamper. Don't wanna be left behind.,6154
Uranami,I'm super scared right now.,6155
Uranami,I keep a collection of cute pets. Stop by again and I'll show you my axofrostl and swolejuu.,6155
Uranami,The massive Meowfficer's super fluffy I mean ripped. Built like a fridge!,6156
Uranami,Last year I said the early bird catches the worm which got me thinking about birds that can't fly. Like ostriches. Do they still catch the worm? Hopefully. Anyhoo I made you this chocolate ostrich – or as I like to call it a Chocoboo. Enjoy-doye.,6156
Uranami,It's snowing! I've finished rallying the forces so let us advance!,6157
Uranami,The best thing about winter is skiing in the snow!,6157
Uranami,Today I will transform into a snow bunny!,6158
Uranami,The snow is so sparkly and soft it's very fun.,6158
Uranami,You shouldn't underestimate me~ I've been practicing this whole time.,6159
Uranami,My outfit is thick therefore wholesome,6159
Uzuki,Although submarines are terrifying but I’m not afraid of airplanes!,6160
Uzuki,So can we run?,6160
Uzuki,Eh?! First place goes to me is this ok?,6161
Uzuki,Oops I think I timed it wrong!,6161
Uzuki,Your chocolate flew off with the wind too? Wowie! Then we're in the same boat! Here have some of my candy to cheer you up~,6162
Uzuki,Is it morning already?,6162
Uzuki,Mission rewards~! Is there candy?,6163
Uzuki,Mail? Oh I stuffed it under the pillow and forgot about it!,6163
Vanguard,Is that Bismarck over there? Gracious this will be quite awkward,6164
Vanguard,The port seems to be all in order and I can confidently say you're as well-guarded as can be!,6164
Vanguard,Pardon my bluntness but Royal cuisine is total shite. Sure different people like different things but something's wrong if even I as a native think it's rubbish.,6165
Vanguard,My duty as a palace guard is to aid and protect you at all times.,6165
Vanguard,Thank you for ceasing your inappropriate behaviour right at *gasp*! Do you have a death wish?,6166
Vanguard,Yes? How can I help?,6166
Vanguard,Mission complete. *sigh* I should've checked on it sooner.,6167
Vanguard,Come! Let's settle this fair and square!,6167
Vanguard,Tsk. You'll pay for this you hear?! No I'm fine. Take the others and retreat quickly.,6168
Vanguard,This is a knight's swordsmanship!,6168
Vanguard,Tsk What a persistent bunch!,6169
Vanguard,*sigh* If you're not suited for the job just admit it so we can find a replacement. Stop acting tough it just makes you look pathetic.,6169
Vanguard,So what's on the schedule for today? You'll be working overtime filing paperwork? I'm sorry to hear that. Be that as it may you will be present during today's exercise right?,6170
Vanguard,While yes I am a palace guard that doesn't mean I should be stuck in port. Won't you let me sortie already? *sigh* I'm going mad. The stress is killing me,6170
Vanguard,What? You're working overtime AGAIN? I understand it has to be done but this is a bit ridiculous I won't force you to order a sortie but please can't you make one happen somehow? You can? Brilliant!,6171
Vanguard,By this ring my sword and my life now belongs to you 'til the end of time! All righty do you mind if I tone down the formality a bit? I mean what's the point in being super serious 'round the clock?,6171
Vanguard,Ah there you are. Yeah yeah I'm here with you. That's my duty as your secretary and guard But truth be told I do it just because I want to.,6172
Vanguard,See? This is an unassuming flat – unlike Lady Formidable's place. A knight's residence should be orderly and free of– Don't go digging through my shelves!,6172
Vanguard,A sortie is an opportunity for me to flourish! The glory is nice too but I think we can all agree the best part is showing the world what we're made of!,6173
Vanguard,Being as graceful as Lady Hood would be a huge undertaking M-mind you I'm not saying it would be impossible!,6173
Vanguard,Royal breakfast is all right that much I'll personally vouch for! If you're curious to try it I'm willing to cook it myself!,6174
Vanguard,If you need some enemies sent to the scrapyard take me out of the dock and send me on a sortie! Preferably with Lady Victorious – she and I would likely get along!,6174
Vanguard,What? There's a package for me? Look I can explain It's nothing noteworthy really Just you know some cute comics.,6175
Vanguard,Whatever you need done give me the honour. A knight is always ready to serve.,6175
Vanguard,I-I'm not some idiot who'll admit to liking this no way,6176
Vanguard,If you want to pat my head then I guess that's fine.,6176
Vanguard,A new mission's come– Oh god this one's going to be a pain.,6177
Vanguard,The commission team's back. Let's head out to meet them. And while we're at it let us sortie!,6177
Vanguard,Yes! YES! It's my time to shine!,6178
Vanguard,Behold! My royal sabreee! Wait what? They're all gone? Oh god I can feel everyone's cringing at me!,6178
Vanguard,You picked the wrong fight. Try harder next time if you don't want to make fools of yourselves.,6179
Vanguard,This This move is too cringeworthy to name so forget it!,6179
Vanguard,"Please let me know if you need anything Master"" I'm starting to think you're making me wear this as a sick joke. The reason being I am obviously NOT fit to be a Royal Maid Even if I do adore their uniforms",6180
Vanguard,Why do you insist on having me as a maid? I can hardly cook and I'm terrible at cleaning. Wait Don't tell me maids are your kink,6180
Vanguard,While Royal Maids also participate in battle their approach differs greatly from us knights. The only way I can put it is they hold back too much?,6181
Vanguard,"Yes Master? ""Getting the hang of this"" eh Are you making fun of me?",6181
Vanguard,I have both secretary AND maid work to do *sigh* Will I ever get to sortie again?,6182
Vanguard,As you say. Your wish is my command.,6182
Vanguard,Compare me to any of the other maids and I'll destroy you.,6183
Vanguard,You have a new mission Master. Please review it.,6183
Vanguard,The commission team has returned to port. I shall accompany you to them.,6184
Vanguard,I beat the crap out of them with grace and elegance! Hahah!,6184
Vanguard,This sucks I told you I wasn't cut out for this.,6185
Vanguard,How would you evaluate my performance as a maid? Ill-suited though I am for this job I can still accomplish any task you can throw at me Y-you want me to keep doing this? You know I really feel like you just enjoy watching me suffer!,6185
Vauquelin,Aah so it's like that huh. I understand everything now. Let me take it on NOT!,6186
Vauquelin,What's up? Need me to do you a favor?,6186
Vauquelin,A mission you say? Hehehe! Finally it's my time to shine!,6187
Vauquelin,Mail? Oh I'll go get it then!,6187
Vauquelin,For all your hard work you deserve a headpat Whuah! Spare me that expression of yours!,6188
Vauquelin,A commission's complete! Just F-Y-I! So yeah let's go receive the returning team.,6188
Vauquelin,You're not gonna dump additional work on me now are you?,6189
Vauquelin,Witness the true might of a LARGE destroyer!,6189
Vauquelin,MVP! This calls for a celebratory cool pose Uhh why's everyone giving me funny looks?,6190
Vauquelin,I'm strong as heck! Probably!,6190
Vauquelin,Stay calm and wait for the right time!,6191
Vauquelin,Something that's bothered me lately? Well Tartu asked me for advice on becoming more ladylike so I thoughtlessly recommended this detective novel I've been reading and she apparently got hooked on reading it It feels like that was a mistake you know?,6191
Vauquelin,"Whether I'm actually dumb or not doesn't matter but sometimes I like pretending to be stupid. Then when I do something smart people are gonna be like ""Whoa you're a genius Vauquelin!"" That's how it goes! I mean it does right?",6192
Vauquelin,Holy smokes You really meant that thing the other day about getting married?! Well not to say I took it as a joke or didn't believe you or anything Uhh I mean Y-you get what I'm trying to say right?,6192
Vauquelin,Let's throw out all those yucky vegetables! Yeah all of them! Including yours too!,6193

Vauquelin,That enemy had a stealable item you can't get anywhere else?! You should've said so! There's no way to load saves here!,6202

Victorious,To celebrate your victory why not wear this olive wreath? I'm certain it'll suit you.,6219
Victorious,Stop loafing around! I promised the commission team that I'd use my planes to photograph the moment they entered the port!,6219
Victorious,Words are not needed to praise me! It's not people's words that touch the heart it's their actions!,6220
Victorious,Sigh all that cannons and gunpowder can do is make is war even uglier,6220
Victorious,When my foes have been this thoroughly defeated not even I the symbol of victory can truly be glad.,6221
Victorious,Remaining dignified even in defeat: this is how one should lose a battle!,6221
Victorious,Oh dear I've let my guard down.,6222
Victorious,Don't think too hard about it. Just follow my lead at your own pace. Come on this is a day to celebrate don't be so nervous~ From this day on you'd better work hard to always please me!,6222

Victorious,What should we start off with today?,6227
Victorious,A few words of advice from me: Invitations should be sent early the venue should be grandiose the programme should be discussed with everyone and your attire should be flamboyant — just like mine~,6228
Victorious,Having trouble deciding? If I was in your position I'd just circle everything then figure out the specifics later.,6228
Victorious,Unicorn what kind of outfit would you like for next time? I'll make it for you~,6229
Victorious,I'll have an eye out for you so if you need me for anything just call~,6229

Victorious,Let's teach them a harsh lesson!,6232
Victorious,A beautiful victory — now this is elegance~ Hehe~,6233
Vincennes,Wanna space out and stare at the clouds?,6233
Vincennes,Because my sisters like to take care of everything for me my primary responsibility is spacing out.,6234
Vincennes,Surely it wouldn't hurt to skip a few of these missions,6234
Vincennes,Looks like there's new mail but it's too far away Don't wanna go,6235
Vincennes,The commission fleet's back Looks like spacing out time is over,6235
Vincennes,What's the point of getting stronger anyway?,6236
Vincennes,Wanna go swim together?,6236
Vincennes,V is for victory!,6237
Vincennes,It's time to get serioush!,6237
Vincennes,I I can still keep fighting! Probably,6238
Vincennes,Quincy is always busy helping other people so she never has time to space out with me,6238
Vincennes,You don't act the same towards everyone? Then how come whenever you look at me your face is always so gentle Why is that?,6239
Vincennes,Even though being with my sisters is already a lot of fun as long as you're with me I feel like we'll have even more fun! So let's continue getting along!,6239
Vincennes,I put a lot of work into making this chocolate. First tell me I did good then I'll give you your present. Well you don't *have* to praise me since I made it for you in the first place,6240
Vincennes,Here Vincennes has some chocolate for you. Mm since I did such a good job I'm going back to sleep Well yeah I'm always sleepy but now I'm doubly sleepy because I worked hard so it's not quite the same,6240
Vincennes,Taking it easy savoring my chocolate while drinking tea Yeah this is the life. I'm proud to say I'm living the dream right now~,6241
Vincennes,Zzz sho comfy Huh? Commyander?,6241

Vincennes,A photo op? Sure Lemme make a pose~,6246
Vincennes,What did I learn in class? Dunno the clouds outside looked really neat,6246
Vincennes,I saw a black cat on the way to school this morning Wonder if it's some kind of omen?,6247
Vincennes,Why isn't there some class just for spacing out,6247
Vincennes,Nyahh! Th-this is a violation of school rules!,6248
Vincennes,Is the next class starting?,6248
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Anything GB can help you with? I'm the oldest among my siblings and can do absolutely anything! Go on let's hear it!,6249
Vincenzo_Gioberti,S-Simoom isn't around here is she? Ahem! Not to imply I'm afraid of her my question simply stems from a sincere desire for amity and courtliness.,6249
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Oh goodness! Seriously could you not pull weird faces while I'm trying to work?,6250
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Huh? I've not done anything weird have I?,6250
Vincenzo_Gioberti,H-hey! I've grown out of headpats! They don't work on me nuh-uh!,6251
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Hm? New mission directives? But I'm not ready yet Oh they're not for me?,6251
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Mission completed. Now where's the rewards report?,6252
Vincenzo_Gioberti,How about a victory hug for everyone? Would that make me seem more mature?,6252
Vincenzo_Gioberti,The commission team has returned!,6253
Vincenzo_Gioberti,One step closer to blooming into a gorgeous signorina!,6253
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Hehe easy as pizza pie! Err I mean Of course just as expected! Nothing to get excited over!,6254
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Dangit You won't discourage me so easily!,6254
Vincenzo_Gioberti,I'm going all-out!,6255
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Oh no! Deploy smokescreens!,6255
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Hmm I wonder how long it'll be before I become a fine lady like Veneto,6256
Vincenzo_Gioberti,You only find my floundering endearing and cute because you make me flounder so much! Th-th-that said I'm perfectly fine with being called c-cute,6256
Vincenzo_Gioberti,If you and I had met under different circumstances like as classmates then maybe we'd be in a typical romantic relationship J-just thinking out loud that's all!,6257
Vincenzo_Gioberti,I leave you with this chocolate and a question: what's the reason you got this gift? Is this God rewarding you for all the hard work you do? Or is this GB returning the kindness you've shown her? Mull it over for a while,6257
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Chocolate? Of course I've made some for you! Not just because I'm such a cordial lady but because you're always so nice to me! That alone is reason enough for me,6258
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Here your Valentine's chocolate. I had it prepared all along. All cordiality aside you have a very special place in my heart. To NOT give you chocolate today would simply be an injustice!,6258
Vincenzo_Gioberti,You may drink to your heart's content today! Worry not just put it on my tab! Huh? The drinks were free to begin with?,6259
Vincenzo_Gioberti,"This ""for adults only"" drink has gott my attention Could I at least have a taste?",6259
Vincenzo_Gioberti,We have some lovely tiramisu resting on the counter Libeccio! Call over Maestrale and we'll all savor it together!,6260
Vincenzo_Gioberti,Fare un brindisi! Indeed this is how a signorina raises a toast.,6260
Vincenzo_Gioberti,You'll never receive another party invitation from me again!,6261
Vittorio_Veneto,May I offer you some succulent tea and a biscuit before you start your work for the day?,6261
Vittorio_Veneto,This may be unbecoming fo me to say but nevertheless It would delight me if you would use one of our baths. It would let you fully appreciate the splendor of our Empire.,6262
Vittorio_Veneto,The power of a cannon cannot be gauged by its caliber alone. Any who underestimate my 15-inch battery will pay dearly for their misjudgment.,6262
Vittorio_Veneto,Even I – the flagship of the Empire's fleet – enjoy leisure breaks from time to time. There will always come some downtime no matter how tirelessly one works.,6263
Vittorio_Veneto,Let it be known that this sort of behavior is abjectly inappropriate no matter your motive for it.,6263
Vittorio_Veneto,May I offer a bit of advice? Choose your friends carefully.,6264
Vittorio_Veneto,Were my tortellini to your tastes? I must make more to give to the returning commission team you see.,6264
Vittorio_Veneto,Eternal Flagship Vittorio Veneto sallying forth!,6265
Vittorio_Veneto,Sardegna's hope faith and love shall be felt all across the world's seas with our fleet as its emissaries.,6265
Vittorio_Veneto,The enemy overpowering you by sheer force is the most easily acceptable reason for a defeat,6266
Vittorio_Veneto,Witness the Empire's prowess!,6266
Vittorio_Veneto,You hope to defeat me? With attacks this lackluster?,6267
Vittorio_Veneto,It seems I must reassess the Empire's future,6267
Vittorio_Veneto,I never would've thought one day I'd sit down for teatime with Illustrious of all people. Fate is truly a strange thing I suppose.,6268
Vittorio_Veneto,I see not only my Sardegnian friends but all members of the fleet beaming with joy. How you managed this feat I don't know but it fascinates me to no end.,6268
Vittorio_Veneto,Do you comprehend the significance of this vow? Our futures are henceforth interconnected. I would normally not have accepted your proposal so easily but your sheer passion won me over. Heehee.,6269
Vittorio_Veneto,What lay before your eyes is Sardegna's glory. Well not quite – it is my handmade chocolate. Say why not put aside work for just one day to focus on learning more about the Empire – and about me? Hehehe~,6269
Vittorio_Veneto,Whew Well how does it feel to bask in the Empire's glory? I should warn you basking for too long may make you dizzy so kindly tell me when you'd like to get up. Oh and don't forget that I have chocolate for you when that time comes,6270
Vittorio_Veneto,Oh I suppose it's time for work. Allow me just a moment to tidy things up.,6270
Vittorio_Veneto,Self-care is important. When you're out on a sortie don't you wish you could come back to a warm bath every day? Not exactly?,6271
Vittorio_Veneto,You and Littorio are similar in a certain way. Namely your tendency to rely on me for help~,6271
Vittorio_Veneto,I do not condone this but since you're so insistent Ohoho.,6272
Vittorio_Veneto,Is this letter from your friend? Ah. Heehee. I'm sure your friends are all lovely people.,6272
Vittorio_Veneto,Could you give this a taste? Oh dear I might have used too much salt. I thought the commission team might prefer stronger seasoning.,6273
Vittorio_Veneto,Basking in the sunlight feeling the sea breeze and listening to the sound of the waves Ahh it's wonderful to have a relaxing day off.,6273
Vittorio_Veneto,A shipgirl gazing out at the sea from atop a ship It sounds almost like the setup for a joke! I'll have to tell Littorio about it later. Hehehe~,6274
Vittorio_Veneto,Would you care to sunbathe with me? It's delightfully pleasant I assure you.,6274
Volga,In case of an emergency Um I mean you can always rely on me emergency or not!,6275
Volga,Arkhangelsk can I bring vodka to the next tea party? Ehh I can't? Aww,6275
Volga,"Heh heh~ I might not look it but I sure pack a punch on the battlefield! Huh? The ""might not look it"" part is unnecessary?",6276
Volga,I'm coming~ Did you need something from me?,6276
Volga,If that's how you feel about me then Huh? It was an accident??,6277
Volga,W-wait I'm supposed to be the big sister here right? I I'm sure of it!,6277
Volga,You've got a letter~ Wouldn't it be nice if your friends are inviting you to do something fun?,6278
Volga,The commission fleet has returned! I'll go take lunchboxes out to them~,6278
Volga,I'm a REAL aircraft carrier after all~,6279
Volga,I'll do my best to offer air support!,6279
Volga,Our march forward is unstoppable! We shall endure no matter what until the final victory is ours!,6280
Volga,So this is defeat But the final victory will eventually be ours!,6280
Volga,Now's the time to give it our all!,6281
Volga,The final victory will be ours!,6281
Volga,A nice person doesn't cause trouble for their friends got it?,6282
Volga,You can't have an unhealthy lifestyle okay? I know you're busy but nothing is more important than your health.,6282
Volga,Give you chocolate? Ah yes I suppose that is a custom at this port. Hmm *tummy grumbles* Oh dear Simply thinking about it made me hungry. Umm What do you say we go to a chocolatier?,6283
Volga,My greatest contribution to this fleet isn't on the battlefield - but rather through courage companionship and love! Heh heh sounds pretty cool doesn't it?,6283
Volga,Having a proper outlet for stress is a trick that'll go a long way whether in work leisure or life itself Well assuming you want a long life that is~,6284
Volga,If you're heading out for battle you can call on me! Heh heh after all I have a great reputation for being reliable right?,6284
Volga,Ehehe if you're really that into me then what can I say~,6285
Volga,Good good you sure did a great job out there~ I'll bring the rewards over to the depot Huh? It's dangerous so it's better to stick together?,6285
Volga,Back from the operation already? *nom* Mmhmm sho who'sh the MVP this time?,6286
Volga,Volga here. I'm currently tracking an important witness. *gurgle* Is my stomach rumbling because this AR game requires so much stamina? Ugh lost track of the witness just now,6286
Volga,All right I've got myself some conclusive evidence this time. Please loop around that way. After that Oh before I forget take this in case you get hungry~,6287
Volga,Belorussiya told me that the bar there serves really good drinks Oh yeah focus focus!,6287
Volga,Kirov should be lying in ambush on the other side All right this is where I show you what I'm made of!,6288
Volga,Now we wait Ugh my cover's been blown There goes the mission,6288
Volga,Ahhhn?! W-wait now's not a very good time,6289
Volga,Shh I'm in the middle of a mission!,6289
Volga,(*grumble*) You heard something just now? Uh I'm sure it was just your imagination! Yeah nothing at all!,6290
Voroshilov,"There is a saying about Kirov and me: ""As hot as an inferno yet as cold as ice."" O-or something like that.",6290
Voroshilov,D-don't act like you get to touch me whenever you want,6291
Voroshilov,Why would you do that?,6291
Voroshilov,Huh? It's already that time? Th-thank you for letting me know. I almost forgot that the commission team was coming back,6292
Voroshilov,Absolute power is an effective insurance policy for our subsequent missions.,6292
Voroshilov,I've undergone countless practice drills. I won't fail!,6293
Voroshilov,As long as your information is ample and your strategy is thorough there's no chance of failure.,6293
Voroshilov,Melt!,6294
Voroshilov,Hang in there Just a little more!,6294
Voroshilov,If you don't have any business with me don't waste time looking for me. We should just do our own jobs and keep an appropriate distance. Wouldn't that be best?,6295
Voroshilov,Do you still think I'm as cold as ice? Haha well that ice melted long ago thanks to you.,6295
Voroshilov,Kirov told me that if I want something I should be bold. I understand that logically but shouldn't I be more careful when it comes to emotions? I mean this is my first time so,6296
Voroshilov,I'd always thought that absence is what makes the heart grow fonder. But staying so close to you and chatting Heehee it's pretty nice.,6296
Voroshilov,Your hands are cold Would you like me to warm them up?,6297
Voroshilov,We should both be more straightforward *blushes*,6297
Voroshilov,I don't quite understand *blushes*,6298
Voroshilov,The cold wind blowing through the steamy water They could be likened to fire and ice couldn't they? Heehee.,6298
Voroshilov,What would I do right now if there was an emergency? Oh I shouldn't waste this date thinking about such things,6299
Voroshilov,Should I get a little closer? Well okay,6299
Voroshilov,Hm? Is there snow on my head or something?,6300
Voroshilov,A new mission hm? I'll add it to our to-do list for later.,6300
Voroshilov,Don't worry. I've gone through my fair share of emergency battle drills!,6301
Wakatsuki,My blade is very heavy so please be careful!,6301
Wakatsuki,Is this my reward? Ehehe~,6302
Wakatsuki,Mission complete! I don't think I've done anything worthy of praise but it does feel great to overcome obstacles together with you!,6302
Wakatsuki,A commission represents the trust of the requester. In other words upholding that contract is righteous and good!,6303
Wakatsuki,My body has become lighter and faster!,6303
Wakatsuki,Vanguard Wakatsuki has arrived! Everyone charge forward with me!,6304
Wakatsuki,The victor has been decided! Drop your weapons and surrender! Hahaha!,6304
Wakatsuki,I shall protect your rear so hurry up and retreat!,6305
Wakatsuki,Just leave it to me!,6305
Wakatsuki,Woah I've got to regain my balance!,6306
Wakatsuki,Why did you have to leave me all alone? Did I do something wrong?,6306
Wakatsuki,Some people will turn their backs on their friends and their beliefs after gaining great power You often read about these greedy powermongers in various stories! If I ever met someone like that one day Hehe~,6307
Wakatsuki,I shall protect you today just as I do every day! Huh? I seem to be in an especially good mood today? Well of course! Nothing makes me happier than being at your side and serving you faithfully!,6307
Wakatsuki,I see! So this is a symbol of my fealty to you! From now on I swear to always remain by your side and to protect you with my life! If you ever need anything just call my name. I'll do anything for you!,6308
Wakatsuki,It may be presumptuous of me but I decided to join in the chocolate-exchanging festivities by making my own for you. If there is anyone you wish to receive chocolates from please give the order and I will summon them at once!,6308
Wakatsuki,The more good things I do the more rewards I'll get from you right?,6309
Wakatsuki,Haguro are you okay? Is it my fault? Oh you're fine? Thank goodness. If someone falls down because of me I'd have to get on my knees and apologize,6309
Wakatsuki,Yes I'll be right out with your order!,6310
Wakatsuki,I I'm going to tell my friends on you!,6310
Wakatsuki,Yay I've been rewarded for my hard work! Ehehe~,6311
Wakatsuki,I can't believe I made a fool of myself in front of you I just wanted to help everyone out with the café but ended up causing more trouble instead Urgh,6311
Warspite,As long as I'm here we can deal with any enemy no matter how far they are.,6312
Warspite,Don't be blinded by statistics. Victory depends on far more!,6312
Warspite,If you make fun of me one more time you'll be eating my 15 inch shells!,6313
Warspite,Body contact? I don't hate it,6313
Warspite,Just so you understand I'm definitely not that sort of erm,6314
Warspite,Missions give out rewards once you complete them. Don't forget that!,6314
Warspite,Whew not a bad fight. Let's rest for a while.,6315
Warspite,Commissions? I suppose I do miss running around on errands Let's go. We need to welcome back those hard workers!,6315
Warspite,Battlefield I'm coming for you.,6316
Warspite,"Don't be confined by the so-called ""limits"". It is indeed possible to be unsinkable!",6316
Warspite,So this is how harsh the battlefield can be.,6317
Warspite,Would you please not act like we're close,6317
Warspite,I'm not very elegant? I'm sorry that I'm not like Hood or the others No I'm not talking about my body,6318
Warspite,How do I put this I'm considered to be one of the older girls yet my body is like this It might be unbecoming of one my age to compete with the younger girls but I wanted to at least be attractive to you What is a lady meant to do,6318
Warspite,I didn't prepare anything for Valentine's Day Ah! How about this Queen's Chocolate? Her majesty had the maids make the chocolate so I assure you the taste will be excellent I'll make sure to remember next year,6319
Warspite,Survival is the key to becoming a stronger person.,6319
Warspite,Battle is the fire that feeds one's growth. And so I fight with all that I have in every conflict.,6320
Warspite,My important parts haven't grown at all? Seems like someone wants to taste my high-angle mounts,6320
Warspite,This year I am in charge of delivering presents to the children of the Royal Navy. Let's get going once I finish decorating this Christmas tree!,6321
Warspite,Even warriors need to rest. Since it's a holiday you shouldn't be too uptight either.,6321
Warspite,Hmm what present should I pick out for Her Majesty? It can't be too expensive or too cheap and it can't be too exotic or too ordinary. What exactly can I get her?,6322
Warspite,If I'm delivering Christmas presents it's only natural to go through the chimney Eh? Wouldn't that make me seem suspicious?,6322
Warspite,Good. Since you are here I can proceed to my next battleground - the important mission of delivering these gifts!,6323
Warspite,We have the finest equipment. Now to turn in a performance worthy of Her Majesty's beauty Behold the Royal Stage!,6323
Warspite,The day's schedule is in your hands.,6324
Warspite,Don't let my name fool you. Warspite is ready to fight whenever and wherever even onstage.,6324
Warspite,I'm no idol Yes idols are nothing like me Hm,6325
Warspite,What do you think of this outfit? It was made with input from the Royal Knights. Should be different from the others'.,6325
Warspite,Her Majesty is certainly all in at the moment but I'm worried she may suddenly lose interest,6326
Warspite,Are you fixing my equipment?,6326
Warspite,Is it time to call the police?,6327
Warspite,A gig request? Maybe you'd better give this to Illustrious,6327
Warspite,Rewards. I never thought Cesare would be sending them.,6328
Warspite,I'm going to win even in a skirt!,6328
Warspite,(Did I take it too far?),6329
Warspite,If I were just a little faster!,6329
Wasp,It’s said that the archers of Sakura Empire is totally different from mine. So I really want to see it.,6330
Wasp,Zipper? Hehe please don’t mind me. This is just more convenient for me to move around~,6330
Wasp,The commission fleet has returned that’s good to hear. I also want to head out Co-man-der~,6331
Wasp,Oh my physical strength has grown stronger it's time to customize my bow.,6331
Wasp,Let me give you a taste of my Wasp battle style!,6332
Wasp,Hehe I am very good right?,6332
Wasp,Umm it seems that today’s status is not very good,6333
Wasp,If you don’t want to get shot by me then just stay away,6333
Wasp,One cannot simply dodge the sting of my arrows! But I'm no cupid and you can't really attach chocolate to an arrow I suppose. Anyway! Here's my Valentine's chocolate handed to you in person!,6334
Wasp,So how do you like my chocolate arrow? As you can tell there's not just an arrowhead but a shaft and feathers too all made of chocolate! Next year I'll see if I can craft a chocolate bow!,6334
Wasp,So Intrepid told me that people who get Valentine's chocolate will have good luck for a few days – but of course that's a joke. Though it's not really a joke that Intrepid would make. After all wishing for your happiness and good fortune is no joke~,6335
Wasp,If I were you I wouldn't undersell that arrow as a mere piece of chocolate. The moment you caught that masterwork in your hand your heart fell prey to me. In other words you're already in love with me Wait no I mean you're being hunted Yeah.,6335
Weser,Before you hurry off to do your work why not first take a seat and enjoy a cup of coffee?,6336
Weser,The Iron Blood doesn't have as many aircraft carriers as the other factions so I can't help but worry that we'll be at a disadvantage during practice exercises.,6336
Weser,The Unsinkable Battleship? Oh I know who you're talking about. I wonder if I'll ever be able to meet my renowned predecessor Seydlitz at some point?,6337
Weser,If you're tired just set everything else aside and get some rest. I'll wake you up if somebody comes around.,6337
Weser,Your spirited enthusiasm You might want to change the way you convey it.,6338
Weser,New missions? There's no need to hurry. We can check them after you finish whatever you're doing right now.,6338
Weser,Mission complete. Don't worry it's not like the rewards will run off somewhere. You just need to make sure to collect them later.,6339
Weser,There's some mail for you. If it's nothing urgent just read them later.,6339
Weser,The commissions team is back? We shouldn't leave them waiting there like that Should I go ahead and greet them first?,6340
Weser,Keep calm and persevere. Victory will surely come to us.,6340
Weser,Victory just as I expected.,6341
Weser,Ugh I wonder if I'm still not used to my planes,6341
Weser,The time has come!,6342
Weser,It's not yet time to panic.,6342
Weser,The battlefield is a place where the unexpected occurs. If you simply insist on following the orders given to you by the higher-ups you'll never be able to achieve victory.,6343
Weser,Peter is quite brilliant but she can also be quite dreary. I wish she'd loosen up about time and planning and all and learn to just have fun sometimes.,6343
Weser,I believe that the way we live isn't influenced by our environment but rather the choices we've made. That's why I've always lived by my own tempo. What do you think about the way I live my life?,6344
Weser,Have you matched your stride to my tempo or have I matched mine to meet yours? Putting all that aside you know having you by my side makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. Hehe.,6344
Weser,I could give you this luxurious box of chocolates but then I would expect something equally valuable in return. Does that sound good to you? Wonderful. You're a generous soul – I like that.,6345
Weser,What should one give in return for handmade chocolate? More handmade food I assume? I don't know how much of a chef you are but there's a mischievous side of me that can't wait to find out.,6345
Weser,I've been waiting for you Comander. As per my sister's recommendation I've put on this Sakura Empire kimono. It was very tricky to get into I might add That aside how do I look? Good enough I hope?,6346
Weser,Have you already decided what we'll do today? If not take your time. The goddess of time is a patient one.,6346
Weser,Sit down and relax. Have some rich tea or read a nice book to ease off.,6347
Weser,The Sakura Empire's New Year's banquet? I'd love to go but Eugen can you promise you won't get drunk out of your mind again?,6347
Weser,Cozy winter sunsets really make you drowsy I just take a short nap Zzz,6348
Weser,Oh we're going to a Sakura Empire shrine for New Year's? Heheh. I'm looking forward to the memories we'll make today.,6348
Weser,Okay you've proven just how tenacious you are. Now could you stop it already?,6349
Weser,Welcome back. Give me a moment to put in a bookmark.,6349
Weser,This dress took just about forever to pick out. Judging from your reaction though I can see that it wasn't time wasted hehe.,6350
Weser,Are you getting bored? Want to head out to enjoy the breeze together?,6350
Weser,That is not a chivalrous way to conduct yourself.,6351
Weser,How about doing something else for a change of pace? Just let me know if you want to spend some time together whether it's inside the banquet hall or outside.,6351
Weser,I've been waiting forever for this season to arrive. It's a perfect time the waves wait for nobody so I'm off for now. I'll make sure to teach you how to surf later so look forward to it.,6352
Weser,You can already ride the waves? Then how about coming along for some practice?,6352
Weser,"The surfing lesson is about to begin so put on these casts. I had Akashi make these ""surfboard posture correction casts"" for you. Once you put these on your feet you'll be able to understand how to ride the waves instinctively.",6353
Weser,Surfing is fun to me because unlike cruising on the ocean's surface while using my rigging it feels like I'm gliding through the water.,6353
Weser,Don't head over there—you'll be washed out into the open sea. Never underestimate the power of Mother Nature.,6354
Weser,Haven't you skateboarded with Minneapolis before? It's not exactly the same as surfing but try to remember the feeling you had while skateboarding.,6354
Weser,Looks like you fell off of your board. You're a beginner so you shouldn't feel too bad about it.,6355
Weser,If you're having such an easy time that you can mess around maybe I should raise the intensity of your training?,6355
Weser,That was a fantastic wave. Now that you've cooled off go take a shower and chill out for a bit.,6356
West_Virginia,You’re late the exercise has already begun hurry!,6356
West_Virginia,This should be a friendly gesture I suppose.,6357
West_Virginia,Carrying out missions is an important part of enhancing the strength of the fleet.,6357
West_Virginia,The mission was nicely executed good one.,6358
West_Virginia,Could these be letters from my sisters?,6358
West_Virginia,What a peaceful port it reminds me of Hawaii before the war.,6359
West_Virginia,It seems the Spokane Cup this year will still be mine.,6359
West_Virginia,Have you seen this? This is the inevitably tragic ending of those who dare challenge the BIG SEVEN.,6360
West_Virginia,I don't want to recall the humiliation I suffered on that day!,6360
West_Virginia,Have a taste of my 406mm guns!,6361
West_Virginia,I was once seriously injured but then I was greatly enhanced during the process for my repairs,6361
West_Virginia,I’m proud of my BIG SEVEN title. But aircraft carriers seem to be replacing us battleships in naval battles. I am losing myself in all this confusion: this strength that I possess what is it for?,6362
West_Virginia,A couple of us Big Sevens joined forces to make this chocolate. Please take it. It should taste good since Rodney gave us a hand More than good actually! I'm confident you'll love it!,6362
West_Virginia,Sorry but I don't have the gumption the make my own chocolate. If you don't mind you can at least have this Just don't expect much. What I'd be at a loss if it turned out bad!,6363
West_Virginia,Woah it doesn't taste bad? Phew That's a huge relief. I was freaking out when you asked me for handmade chocolate. So I hope I'm not sounding like a broken record here but are you sure you're not just saying that?,6363
Wichita,You've returned. You really kept me waiting. Get ready to depart.,6364
Wichita,Relish in the power of a true heavy cruiser!,6364
Wichita,Look! Our conquest extends to the ends of this blue sea!,6365
Wichita,There exists no problem that a shot from my huge cannons cannot resolve!,6365
Wichita,What is it want to have a go with me?,6366
Wichita,Are you trying to get a taste of my whip?,6366
Wichita,A new mission? Read it out loud for me.,6367
Wichita,You're giving ME a reward?!,6367
Wichita,I'm entrusting the mail to you.,6368
Wichita,Hm? Looks like a commission's been completed Hmph a few commissions are easy pickings for our mighty fleet.,6368
Wichita,With this kind of power!,6369
Wichita,All units fire at will!,6369
Wichita,Hah! These weaklings are no match for me!,6370
Wichita,Now this is interesting. Hmph fall back!,6370
Wichita,This shot will be it for you!,6371
Wichita,How about unveiling what secret plan you have in store for me?,6371
Wichita,Hmph it seems I made the wrong decision by relying on someone as useless as you,6372
Wichita,My dream is to conquer the world! What happens after I've done that? Hmph who cares about that!,6372
Wichita,You're curious about my whip? Well I bought it on a whim long ago but it's been surprisingly useful. Particularly when I'm pointing at a map.,6373
Wichita,I see you as my best friend No I'm not planning on treating you as my best friend Hold on let me think for a moment. No that doesn't mean I'm turning you down Just give me some time to ready my heart for this,6373
Wichita,This is a present from Lady Wichita! And one day I'll give you all the chocolate on the Seven Seas! There's no chocolate out on the Seven Seas? I-I see,6374
Wichita,Got some Valentine's chocolate for you and it's packed full of love! If you thought I only paid attention to you because of your abilities you'd be dead wrong!,6374
Wichita,I really appreciate that you've always been there to lend me your wisdom. So I'm giving you this Valentine's chocolate in return. It's just a formality though - if there's ever anything you need from me feel free to ask away. If it's something I can get for you then I'll do that. If not just add it to the list of things I owe you. How does that sound?,6375
Wichita,Mannerisms etiquette dress codes Hmph. This is all more convoluted than naval battles that's for sure. Still I agreed to participate so I mustn't act like a total simpleton.,6375
Wichita,What are you looking at? You want a drink huh? Why didn't you just say so right away?,6376
Wichita,Even the world's best warrior would succumb to exhaustion if they never stopped fighting. Everyone needs time off for recreation you know? So enjoy yourself tonight.,6376
Wichita,Not going to lie St. Louis's car looked really slick. I'm considering asking for the keys and taking it for a spin later.,6377
Wichita,Hey! You nearly put your hand on my shoulder there Try to avoid doing that in public at the very least.,6377
Wichita,You want to play do you? Come here!,6378
Wichita,Hah! Pathetic. Can't they send someone who'll put up a fight?,6378
Wichita,Ghosts? Goblins? Hah! On this night they too are under my control! Hahahaha!,6379
Wichita,Trick-or-treaters? It's your job to deal with those. Wouldn't want to risk petrifying any children with my terrific costume.,6379
Wichita,Raising the brim of my witch hat to reveal my razor-sharp fangs – now that's what I'm talking about!,6380
Wichita,Come familiar. Get up on the pumpkin and take in the Halloween spirit.,6380
Wichita,Desperate to once more taste the sting of my whip are we?,6381
Wichita,My fangs and ears look very realistic? Of course they do. I had them specially procured just for this holiday.,6381
Yamakaze,Woooo! I'm pumped and ready to do some work!,6382
Yamakaze,If you don't play with me right now I'm gonna roar at you! Fine Rooooar!,6382
Yamakaze,Hey Kawakaze! Have some fun for once and come play with me and Umikaze!,6383
Yamakaze,Do you wanna play knock-out boxing?,6383
Yamakaze,Argh! I'll turn you into red paste!,6384
Yamakaze,Rooooar!,6384
Yamakaze,New missions have come in! Let me at 'em!,6385
Yamakaze,Mission complete! Do I get a share of the loot?,6385
Yamakaze,You're back? Here the seat's all yours!,6386
Yamakaze,Woohoo!,6386
Yamakaze,Woo! Follow my lead!,6387
Yamakaze,We won! Hip hip! Hooray!,6387
Yamakaze,Bwaahh! Get me outta here!,6388
Yamakaze,Onwards! Go! Go!,6388
Yamakaze,Owwieee,6389
Yamakaze,Grrrrr! (Yamakaze is wary of you.),6389
Yamakaze,When those mean Meowfficers gang up on me I scare them off with a roar!,6390
Yamakaze,You're always so nice to me so I'm gonna be nice back! If any baddies show up I'll send them scurrying back to mama! Huh? You'll protect ME instead? But why?,6390
Yamakaze,I'll promise to stop scaring you but in exchange I wanna play with you more often!,6391
Yamakaze,Umikaze! I've got a bag full of breadcrumbs! Wanna go feed some seagulls?,6391
Yamakaze,What are we gonna do this time? More knock-out boxing? Sumo wrestling?,6392
Yamakaze,I caught youuuu~,6392
Yamakaze,I'm prepped and ready for my big trick! Woo!,6393
Yamakaze,I'm gonna surprise everyone with a jaw-dropping trick at the banquet venue! But first I need to come up with a total jaw-dropper Hmm,6393
Yamakaze,White doves should be part of any good magician's act!,6394
Yamakaze,Watch closely! I'm now going to make this flower dis– What the?! Why'd it turn into a handkerchief?!,6394
Yamakaze,Woah! Stop trying to figure out my tricks!,6395
Yamakaze,Presto! I've magically retrieved your mail!,6395
Yat_Sen,Ning Hai's steamed buns? Mm they still have the same nostalgic flavor.,6396
Yat_Sen,Only by remembering the lessons of the past can we move towards a brighter future.,6396
Yat_Sen,Sometimes I miss those days when I used to train together with all my sisters,6397
Yat_Sen,What's wrong? Please don't have any strange expectations of me.,6397
Yat_Sen,I am no longer the crybaby that I once was.,6398
Yat_Sen,New missions have been assigned! I have finished preparations and am awaiting your orders.,6398
Yat_Sen,Mission rewards counted and ready for your review me? No there's nothing I want,6399
Yat_Sen,Ahh home is such a warm place.,6399
Yat_Sen,The girls have already returned from commission. Aren't we going to greet them?,6400
Yat_Sen,If only I was able to become this strong sooner then perhaps,6400
Yat_Sen,Ancestors Yat Sen shall now do her part as well.,6401
Yat_Sen,As the wind blows anew I can feel my presence once more.,6401
Yat_Sen,Give up? Why would I do that? I am not the same fragile Yat Sen as before.,6402
Yat_Sen,It ends now!,6402
Yat_Sen,I have already witnessed true hell.,6403
Yat_Sen,When I look at your face I sometimes forget to breathe What a strange sensation.,6403
Yat_Sen,This is the power of our bond? Every moment we are together is like a dream one that I am afraid of waking up from. No it is no matter. From now on I shall always be by your side.,6404
Yat_Sen,"Two connected hearts beat as one."" Perhaps it was fate that brought the two of us together. It might also be fate that you'll be the first person to receive my chocolate. Thank you for looking after me as well as everyone else in the port.",6404
Yat_Sen,If I told you that there's much I still want to learn about you Would you entertain my request? Heehee~,6405
Yat_Sen,Ying Swei and Chao Ho To outsiders those two girls might seem like they don't get along very well. But people who understand them will find their antics delightful and amusing. Heehee.,6405
Yat_Sen,In the past I used to pray that I would become stronger. Now I pray that I may understand both the warmth and coldness of this world. Naturally I would like to experience those things to better accompany you and my other friends heehee.,6406
Yat_Sen,Did you need me? I am willing to hear you out at any time.,6406
Yat_Sen,All inappropriate conduct will be held to account.,6407
Yat_Sen,Indeed home is the place that truly makes your heart feel at ease.,6407
Yat_Sen,For us to walk hand in hand until we become old is my greatest wish.,6408
Yat_Sen,I am now able to move forward without doubts and it's all thanks to you dear.,6408
Yat_Sen,I never realized it before but being by your side like this watching Ping Hai and Ning Hai grow and seeing the merriment of the other Dragon Empery children makes me see that I am truly blessed.,6409
Yat_Sen,Is something the matter dear? Yat Sen is always there for you. Yes no matter what.,6409
Yat_Sen,P-Please don't be so hasty dear at least wait until we get back to our room,6410
Yat_Sen,Awaiting the return of a loved one is a warm feeling.,6410
Yat_Sen,As long as you're with me there's nothing that Yat Sen cannot do.,6411
Yat_Sen,Even if we are to be separated our hearts will always beat as one. Do you feel the same way about me my dear? Hehe~,6411
Yat_Sen,This is rather embarrassing but Chen Hai somehow found out that I'd be meeting with you so she made me change into this outfit S-so how does it look on me?,6412
Yat_Sen,Being able to spend peaceful days with my friends fills me with warmth and happiness. Spending time with you is yet another special kind of happiness.,6412
Yat_Sen,Thanks to you the port's Lunar New Year celebration has become more and more lively each year. As a result there are more and more kids we have to keep an eye on I suppose that's one of the downsides of being too blessed?,6413
Yat_Sen,Just by putting our hands together like this you can already feel the warmth spreading.,6413
Yat_Sen,Wh-what if one of our friends passes by?,6414
Yat_Sen,Do you find my hairstyle appealing?,6414
Yat_Sen,Do you still have missions left to do? If it's urgent please allow me to help.,6415
Yat_Sen,The mission rewards have already arrived safely at port. There's no need to worry yourself.,6415
Yat_Sen,The mail? An Shan said that if anything new arrives she'll drop by to bring it over.,6416
Yat_Sen,Thank you for your service. I happen to have my tea set with me so if you don't mind I can steep some tea leaves for you.,6416
Ying_Swei,"Going by launch date one could say that I am actually Chao Ho's older sister But alas since she wants that role so badly she can have it. Besides being the ""little sister"" comes with perks of its own. Hehe~",6417
Ying_Swei,Reminder from Ying Swei~ You've had your head in the clouds for a while~,6417
Ying_Swei,Are you interested in the Four Treasures of the Study? I'd be glad to instruct you. Hehe not to boast but I'm quite confident in my abilities.,6418
Ying_Swei,If you're tired you should go ahead and rest. Collapsing due to overwork is inefficient.,6418
Ying_Swei,Wouldn't it be a great time for me to tell everyone how much of a pervert you are? If you want me to reconsider you'll have to make me a little promise first. Hehe~,6419
Ying_Swei,If you mess up my hair I'll have you style it for me for a week starting tomorrow you hear?,6419
Ying_Swei,Mission complete. Now if I could just enjoy a meal soak in the bath and then get into bed that would be the life. Hehe~,6420
Ying_Swei,You've got new mail You know stone-cold printed text doesn't have that same human touch as something handwritten.,6420
Ying_Swei,I'm sure there are a lot of things you're dying to tell me. But that can wait until after you've rested up.,6421
Ying_Swei,The expedition fleet is back. Don't forget to reward all our hardworking friends.,6421
Ying_Swei,Indeed. You must be strong if you wish to protect what is dear to you.,6422
Ying_Swei,Purge all evil. Become as a stalwart blade.,6422
Ying_Swei,I'll wait until I get back before declaring victory.,6423
Ying_Swei,Do I not have enough power to stop the enemy's advance?,6423
Ying_Swei,We shall never fade away!,6424
Ying_Swei,We will not cannot back down here!,6424
Ying_Swei,I have nothing to say to you.,6425
Ying_Swei,Chao Ho has been complaining to you that I've been pushing my chores onto her hasn't she? Don't listen to her. I've just been instructing my little sister who has stubbornly been running away from her responsibilities about the realities of being an adult. Hehe~,6425
Ying_Swei,There are a lot of things I'd like to say to you but whenever I'm in front of you it's like the words just won't come out I'm afraid I'll have to write my feelings out for you so please don't laugh.,6426
Ying_Swei,Ink does not fade with the passage of time I wrote my feelings down with the hope that they also may never fade. I now offer these words to you along with myself.,6426
Ying_Swei,Happy Valentine's. Oh to think that I ended up giving you chocolate before Chao Ho could I wonder how she'll react when she finds out Hehehe,6427
Ying_Swei,Chao Ho and I made a promise that we'd deliver our chocolates together today and neither is allowed to jump the gun But since she still hasn't shown up at our agreed-upon time I suppose I have no choice but to give you my chocolate first. Haha happy Valentine's Day~,6427
Ying_Swei,Happy Valentine's Day. My sister and I struck an agreement to begin from a starting line and race to be the first to find you. So I sent out a manjuu with a hologram device projecting an image of you. Poor Chao Ho she fell for the same trick twice. Heehee,6428
Ying_Swei,We've got a lot of work to do today. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. Hehe don't even think about slacking off~,6428
Ying_Swei,I've brought you a most sophisticated cup of lapsang souchong tea hehe~,6429
Ying_Swei,I like the way you stroke my hair ehehe~ Ah no I didn't say anything.,6429
Ying_Swei,Though I no longer communicate with you through writing I feel like we understand each other much better now. Please continue to share your feelings with me be they amorous or anxious.,6430
Ying_Swei,Chao Ho thinks up the couplets and I write them down. Don't you think we make a good team? Besides seeing Chao Ho's brows furrow in thought is super cute Anyway let's think up some lines together later.,6430
Ying_Swei,Miss Yat Sen I'll help you prepare the food for tonight's reunion dinner. What about the fish? I'll start it up if you'd like.,6431
Ying_Swei,Fu Shun if you throw any more firecrackers into the pond I'll change your seat to be right next to that lotus~,6431
Ying_Swei,Since it's the Spring Festival how about taking a break?,6432
Ying_Swei,The excitement of the festival seems to have gone to your head. Hehe~,6432
Ying_Swei,In the warm spring breeze snow melts and life blooms anew. Spring is the season of life.,6433
Ying_Swei,A~ job~ well~ done~ Hehe did you like that?,6433
Ying_Swei,"An old saying goes ""it's better to be lucky than it is to be punctual."" Since you've come at quite the fortuitous moment why not come sit next to me and enjoy the show? As for what's going on over here don't sweat the small details~",6434
Ying_Swei,This year Hai Tien is in charge of coming up with the Spring Festival couplets I'll be doing the calligraphy and Chao Ho is handling the decorations. An all brawn no brain job like that is perfect for my sister isn't it? Heehee~,6434
Ying_Swei,What's the matter Chao Ho? Still haven't been able to get your stuff back? I tricked you? What could you possibly be talking about?,6435
Ying_Swei,The goods Akashi sent over sure are convenient. There's the mechanical errand-running Manjuus the automatic fireworks launchers and the lion dancers as well I'm sure Fu Shun and her gals would have an absolute blast with these.,6435
Ying_Swei,You also want to try playing a prank on Chao Ho? Sure but don't go too overboard~,6436
Yoizuki,There is little I can do on my own. So please if I can assist in any way don't be afraid to ask. I will help you.,6436
Yoizuki,Why I help people? I feel I should; therefore I do it Is that strange?,6437
Yoizuki,"Forcing myself""? Not at all. If I were my help would only have the opposite effect.",6437
Yoizuki,Do you feel tired? Shall I give you a shoulder massage?,6438
Yoizuki,We have received a mission. Is it something I may take care of?,6438
Yoizuki,I have brought the mission rewards. These should be all of them.,6439
Yoizuki,A commission has been completed. Splendid work.,6439
Yoizuki,This feels rather nice.,6440
Yoizuki,Be careful. Try to stay close to me.,6440
Yoizuki,We have everyone to thank for this victory.,6441
Yoizuki,They tricked us Everyone retreat! I will watch your backs!,6441
Yoizuki,Critical hit!,6442
Yoizuki,I would prefer it if you'd stay away from me.,6442
Yoizuki,Hm? I seem cold and distant to you? I've heard that from Harutsuki before Oh bother,6443
Yoizuki,I know that I can't always be by Harutsuki's side to help when she feels nervous. Yet my body always acts on its own accord,6443
Yoizuki,You don't require my help yet you keep me waiting by your side Why is that? I don't quite understand,6444
Yoizuki,"A ""date""? What does that mean?  It means we'll play together? Certainly if that's what you wish.  Why are you smiling? You're quite strange",6444
Yoizuki,When I'm thinking of you as I make chocolate I get so nervous I can see why Harutsuki prays. I'm slow to catch on so could you show and tell me directly whether this chocolate has made you happy?,6445
Yoizuki,It's my turn? Hold on Umm could you please not stare at me like that? It's making me feel uncomfortable.,6445
Yoizuki,I registered for several sporting events. I must give it my all so I won't slow down my teammates,6446
Yoizuki,I received a good luck charm from Harutsuki It's nice when someone offers you their blessings.,6446
Yoizuki,Harutsuki slow down and match your pace with mine One two! One two!,6447
Yoizuki,All the entrants are strong candidates I'll need to exert myself for the next event too.,6447
Yoizuki,Will you enter with me for the three-legged race? Don't worry we're unbeatable as a pair.,6448
Yoizuki,Mmh Happy New Year. I'm working on hooking my friends up with these firecrackers The bun I'm eating? I received it as a thank-you for my efforts.,6448
Yoizuki,"The noise of the firecrackers is said to repel a monster called the ""Nian."" As for why this monster only appears during Lunar New Year's I'm not quite sure",6449
Yoizuki,Yat Sen's dim sum is wonderful. I'm particularly fond of this meat bun she made.,6449
Yoizuki,If lighting firecrackers sounds too frightening would you like to light a firework instead?,6450
Yoizuki,Make a fai chun? Sorry such things are beyond my means. You may wish to ask Hanazuki or Suzutsuki instead.,6450
Yoizuki,Don't worry it's not very heavy. I'm capable of carrying it.,6451
Yoizuki,Perhaps the noise of the firecrackers can dispel your sinful thoughts too?,6451
Yoizuki,I'm aware that setting off firecrackers is an important Dragon Empery tradition. That said This many firecrackers may be excessive.,6452
Yorck,Excuse me for being so early heehee. Now show me that leadership of yours and make me happy.,6452
Yorck,You're free to regard me as a tool – a means to exert your power. Heehee. I don't mind.,6453
Yorck,Spee if it's friends you want I can be yours. We'll have so much fun together. Heehee,6453
Yorck,That I serve someone is all that matters not whom I serve. It could just as well be Emden as it could be you. Though admittedly very few are able to command me.,6454
Yorck,You look strapped for work which I'm quite happy about. The more things I do for you the easier your job becomes. Isn't that the best arrangement one could want?,6454
Yorck,Hmm? Are you trying to chat me up or issue an order?,6455
Yorck,Oh I see You want the same done to you hmm♥,6455
Yorck,Letting the mission rewards pile up to collect them all in one fell swoop once is more satisfying don't you agree?,6456
Yorck,There's a letter for you. The most I can do is hand it to you sadly. Heehee.,6456
Yorck,Welcome back. Next time you bring me on a sortie please make it as good as the one just now was.,6457
Yorck,Those girls have returned from their commission. You commanded them wisely. Heehee.,6457
Yorck,Why you I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. Heehee.,6458
Yorck,What will you do next? Keep advancing or call it quits and pull back?,6458
Yorck,How unfortunate If only we had more backbone.,6459
Yorck,Hope you like being chopped to pieces. Heehee,6459
Yorck,Seems like covering our rear is my only strong suit.,6460
Yorck,Heehee. You may be a worthless hopeless imbecile but I still have use for you.,6460
Yorck,Kindly tell me if there's something you want me to do. Likewise I'll suggest new things I can do as I come up with them.,6461
Yorck,There are certain things only you can do so try not to become too dependent on me. Having said that I wouldn't refuse if you offered to become my puppet.,6461
Yorck,You really have a charismatic aura that draws people in. It's why you're deserving of my loyalty or should I say my love. Heehee.,6462
Yorck,"From planning the ceremony to sending out invitations you left it all to me. Do I take that to mean you're ready to be mine? Say it then. ""I take Yorck to have and to hold from this day forward."" Let me hear that resolve that desire of yours♥",6462
Yorck,"Everyone's been talking about this ""Valentine's chocolate"" thing so I made some as well. While I don't care much for the custom myself I thought receiving a gift from a tool might rouse something inside you. Heehee. So can I expect to get something in return?",6463
Yorck,Ah you're right on time as you said you would be. I do fancy a person true to their word. Heehee.,6463
Yorck,Before you state your business I'd like to ask a question. Are you here to speak with Yorck the subordinate or me your wife in marriage?,6464
Yorck,You're requesting my aid without even realizing it aren't you? Heehee.,6464
Yorck,You know I think I like it when you somewhat force yourself onto me. Heehee♥,6465
Yorck,Tenacious and brave in the face of incoming attacks I see. There's always so much to learn from your strategies.,6465
Yorck,After all the faith you've put in me this is the least I can do.,6466
Yorck,Your office chair pales in comparison to my throne. Don't you want to sit on it for yourself?,6466
Yorck,A vampire hunter you say? I wonder whether Seydlitz could make it all the way here without your aid.,6467
Yorck,Should it not be you who decides what to do not me?,6467
Yorck,Oh. Oh my,6468
Yorck,There shall be left no trace of your existence.,6468
Yorck,You expected anything different? Victory is par for the course when you're a Goddess.,6469

York,Ahh I tumble into the Nightmare's maws,6490
York,The school has recently been consumed by a series of Mysteries there must be some Mastermind lurking behind the scenes. Yes another Tribulation awaits me! I shall part the veil and reveal all Truths!,6490
York,Now then let us begin today's Investigation! The Mastermind will fall into our trap sooner or later!,6491
York,The figure that suddenly showed up inside empty classrooms turned out to just be Eldridge. The mysterious stack of books in the library was nothing more than a Misdirection left by the Occult Club. And the legends of the Ace who cloned herself to lead every sports club to victory; well she was actually that incredible But the Mastermind still hasn't appeared. Has my Investigation been misguided?,6491
York,Eyepatch? Nay. This is a tool that is necessary to seal off a portion of my Force.,6492
York,Difficult Words annoying Formulae Curses will I be defeated by these things before I am able to reveal the Truth?!,6492
York,Exeter struggles with her Tests on a daily basis but that is for the best. The true Tribulations are mine alone to bear.,6493
York,Until all Truths are revealed and the Mastermind's identity is brought to light I cannot relent!,6493
York,Eeek! Just now could it be There's no doubt about it. The Mastermind took over your body to issue me a Warning!,6494
York,Without delving further into the Zone we will not be able to uncover the Truth. Luckily with you here I will be able to enter realms normally inaccessible to me!,6494
York,You're back? Then let us continue. This time the Unfathomable will respond to our summons!,6495
York,Jamaica Z36 Through this arduous battle I have met many companions who also see through the veil. Now I am no longer alone in my Rebellion against Fate!,6495
York,So the first summoning failed. Such are the tribulations exacted by the Unfathomable. But I shall not capitulate so easily!,6496
York,Bloody hell if not for the fact that my Force is nullified by the slumbering depths' domain I could delve even deeper in the search for Truth!,6496
York,Excellent let us combine our Force and channel it into this magic circle.,6497
York,Ahh! No can it be your mind has been corrupted by the Unfathomable?,6497

Yorktown,Urk. I feel a little sick,6508
Yorktown,I mean it's only natural for a good couple to be a little clingy right? After all I've been through I'm WAY too shy to make the first move. So that means YOU have to do it. Got it?,6509
Yorktown,What kind of souvenir do you think Hammann would like? A warding stone?,6509

Yuubari,Master I've completed the chocolate-manufacturing Manjuu. Your portion will be delivered to you automatically and the rest will be shipped to Akashi. Hmm it almost feels like I'm doing this for Akashi rather than for you Master,6545
Yuubari,I've brought you an automated Manjuu robot that reports on the status of your Valentine's chocolate. The settings can be changed here and the Manjuu can refrigerate any chocolates you can't get to (Muahaha You can't change the settings for MY chocolate though),6546

Z1,You're finally here! Come on I want to start brawling already!,6563
Z1,Heheh~ The mighty Z1 can get even stronger and faster!,6563

Z1,Because she’s the Z1 her results will of course be NO.1! Hehe no matter where she goes Z1-sama will always be the best!,6564
Z1,Bringing weapons to school is merely for self-defense purposes. There are always some bold fool who wishes to taunt Z1-sama!,6565
Z1,The homework was finished in a flash hehe naturally for my Z1-sama!,6565
Z1,I did not break classroom rules! It’s just that the teacher is too boring I recommend to everyone that I should teach the class then,6566
Z1,Hehehe stuff written on books may not always be correct!,6566
Z18,Everyone from Iron Blood are either obsessed with war or say a bunch of stuff that doesn't make sense and my mission is to make them all smile!,6567
Z18,I prescribe a smile to anyone who's feeling afraid~,6567
Z18,I believe that deep down there's a smile in everyone's hearts! Anyone can smile once they know that!,6568
Z18,Do you need anything from me?,6568
Z18,You can't do whatever you want just because I'm smiling! Hmph!,6569

Z18,I'll always smile even when defeated~!,6572
Z18,My smile will reach even the enemy!,6572
Z18,This might not be so good,6573
Z18,People feel sad and anxious when they lose right? That's why I'll be there to cheer them up!,6573
Z18,A smile is always good but when cruelty makes someone smile it's kind of creepy,6574
Z18,It's so so much fun making chocolate – I find myself smiling from start to finish! Here! Eating these is sure to put a smile on your face too! And a smile is the foundation on which a happy year is built!,6574
Z18,We just saw each other and you're already beaming with joy! My hard work this Valentine's is already paying off. For showing me such a wonderful smile you get a smiley chocolate that'll make you even happier!,6575
Z19,I must be more strict with myself now that I'm your secretary.,6575
Z19,Please don't pick me up I'm way too old for that,6576
Z19,Is it finally time for you to play with me?,6576
Z19,Am I one step closer to being an adult?,6577
Z19,All ships at the ready! Aim for the enemy fleet ahead! Feuer!,6577
Z19,Z23! This time I got a perfect score!,6578
Z19,This is the result of all my hard work!,6578
Z19,No matter what skill you have I'm sure there's a place for it.,6579
Z19,Can I really have this? Thank you very much I'll do my best to be a worthy partner!,6579
Z19,I wonder what score you'll give my chocolate this year Wait huh? You want me to grade it myself based on your reaction to tasting it? Hrmhh I mean how could I give your smile anything less than a perfect score?,6580
Z19,I can tell you this right now – that smile is a 10 out of 10 on your happiness scale! I'm sure of it because I've known you for so long. S-seeing you that happy over my chocolate makes me both happy yet embarrassed at the same time,6580
Z20,As long as I'm in a good mood I can enjoy any scenery!,6581
Z20,Protschny? Don't call me by that name!,6581
Z20,Hmm? You want to go on a run with me?,6582
Z20,Hehe how do you like my curves?,6582

Z20,Hahaa! Piece of cake!,6586
Z20,Oof even I mess up sometimes just sometimes~,6587
Z20,Gotta smile during battle as well!,6587
Z20,The moment I saw you all the fatigue from running kicked in at once. I'm out time to rest!,6588
Z20,What's wrong? Something bugging you? I promise you'll feel better if we go run a marathon together!,6588
Z20,If you never tell others how you feel about them they'll never understand. You get that right?,6589
Z20,You idiot All right stop blushing and stammering. I like you. So do you feel the same way about me?,6589
Z20,Since we both love exercising and you liked my spin on last year's gift I went and made you this – my latest and greatest work yet! You'll love it so much it'll fill you with energy and make you wanna go for a run!,6590
Z2,I'll bring you a fresh batch of paperwork if you have nothing better to do. I hope you're ready.,6590
Z2,This little one is Lebe. Yes you heard that correctly; this is Lebe. Isn't she cute?,6591
Z2,Oh absolutely I agree wholeheartedly. Now what's our next task?,6591
Z2,Among all actions that take bravery this would in my honest opinion be the worst kind.,6592
Z2,We've received new missions. I organized them to give you a solid overview. You're welcome.,6592
Z2,I'll obey if you order me to claim the mission rewards but my opinion of you will worsen. Is that an acceptable tradeoff to you?,6593
Z2,You have mail. I propose that you open and read it as soon as possible. You are prone to forgetting about it otherwise.,6593
Z2,I've put together an after-action report as you ordered. Please have a look.,6594
Z2,The commission team has returned. Naturally we should greet and praise them for their hard work. I can accompany you if need be.,6594
Z2,Won't I develop some sort of flaw if I get even stronger?,6595
Z2,Be wary of ambushes and try not to overextend yourselves.,6595
Z2,There are countless examples of seizing defeat from the jaws of victory. Let us not underestimate our foes.,6596
Z2,I'll cover everyone. I'm quite good at these things owing to Lebe's help. You may rest easy.,6596
Z2,I can still go faster. Just a bit more.,6597
Z2,I don't mind being near you but I'm afraid that Lebe does.,6597
Z2,You want to make small talk again? Why? You should know that the only answers I ever offer are nods and affirmations. Could it be that you actually like canned responses like that?,6598
Z2,So this is marriage. I never thought I'd form an unbreakable bond with someone What was that? I'm blushing? Umm could you please take a photo of me right now? I've never seen myself red in the face before.,6598
Z2,"(Z2 gave you a box with two chocolates inside. One of them was made to look like Lebe's ""torso"" and the other is a detailed recreation of Lebe's face. When she gave you the box she said: ""Allow me to offer you these Lebe chocolates. No not that Lebe. My Lebe."")",6599
Z2,I've made a chocolate of Lebe in your likeness and a chocolate of you in Lebe's likeness. Ah you find it ridiculous? Perhaps so but Lebe is quite fond of it. She says the outfit makes her look even more authoritative. Indeed it does.,6599
Z2,Hm? Are you staring at me in hopes of making me initiate conversation? Apologies but I'm afraid that won't happen.,6600
Z2,Do I have any other expressions? A better question is: do you deserve a different expression? I'm joking of course. I'm just too lazy to make any other face. That is all.,6600
Z2,A stroll through the city? I fear we'd be mistaken for a couple so I must kindly decline.,6601
Z2,Allow me to reiterate: Lebe does bite if provoked.,6601
Z2,Welcome back. Please forgive me for greeting you with such an inhospitable look. It is not acceptable behavior on my part. Wait just a moment please. I will massage my face into a better expression.,6602
Z2,Being able to see you all flabbergasted makes changing into this outfit worth it. Are you going to keep standing there like a scarecrow? Come over here~ Who knows we might even be able to see the fireworks from this spot.,6602
Z2,"When we're together like this Yes it does undeniably look like a ""date.",6603
Z2,Lebe I know festivals are fun but I think you're having a bit too much fun,6603
Z2,"A carp becoming a dragon?"" Lebe do you want me to teach you what that means?",6604
Z2,"Festivals delicious food and wondrous scenery Yes I finally understand the miraculous ""summer"" that my Sakura Empire friends spoke of.",6604
Z2,If you wanted to talk to me wouldn't it be better if you at least had a topic in mind? Heh.,6605
Z2,Good work on your sortie. Would you like to recharge with some sweets? For the time being I set these aside for your enjoyment.,6605
Z21,Is there something on my face? Stop staring at me!,6606
Z21,You should be more careful if you want me to be your flagship Don't misunderstand I'm not actually worried about you.,6606
Z21,I'm staying beside you but only because its my duty as secretary ship!,6607
Z21,If you're really tired I suppose you could rest on my lap for a while,6607
Z21,Didn't we agree that you'd give me a heads up before poking me?,6608
Z21,Ah! What what are you doing? One more time and I'll really get mad!,6608
Z21,You're still not going to work? You prefer staying with me? You you're doing this on purpose aren't you?,6609
Z21,I-I suppose you deserve a little bit of praise but only for your hard work.,6609
Z21,There's mail for help you open it? I I guess I can do that reluctantly of course,6610
Z21,G-good work. Hmph!,6610
Z21,Good work everyone! Except the one who's always goofing off in port *ahem*,6611
Z21,Thanks for nothing! I didn't say anything!,6611
Z21,Come on everyone let's give it our all!,6612
Z21,Well I suppose you did contribute a little bit,6612
Z21,Ugh I I'll remember this!,6613
Z21,Combat will be no problem as long as we put in a little effort.,6613
Z21,I'm having a bad day Just stay away from me!,6614
Z21,I'll fight to protect my sisters Not you!,6614
Z21,What kind of stuff do I like? Why should I tell you? Well I guess those macaroons we had yesterday were pretty good.,6615
Z21,I'm not following you! We just happened to be going in the same direction! Where am I going? Why why should I tell you?!,6615
Z21,Since you're being so sincere I'll accept reluctantly! But that doesn't it doesn't mean that I've agreed to anything yet Ah alright don't leave. Yes I agree!,6616
Z21,What do you know it's Valentine's Day. Good thing I bought this chocolate macaroon you can have. L-look I just had it on me because I love macaroons! This is totally not some sort of scheme to get you to start liking my favorite treat!,6616
Z21,Here actual Valentine's chocolate! I made it myself but don't expect too much You can tell it was made to your tastes? Ugh your senses are always keen at the worst times! I mean gifts are MEANT to suit the recipient's tastes you know!,6617
Z23,There's still quite a lot to be done today. No procrastinating!,6617
Z23,If you have the time to stare at me shouldn’t you go back to your studies? Even I can get embarrassed,6618
Z23,Huh? What am I in charge of? A-ahaha I uh forgot,6618
Z23,Headpat? You mean like this?,6619
Z23,If you’re free why not help with some paperwork?,6619
Z23,Completing missions is a great way to hone your skills. Don't ever forget that!,6620
Z23,We still have so much to review about the previous battle,6620
Z23,It’s about time! Please put aside your work and check on the results of your commissions.,6621
Z23,Let’s go! It’s time to reap the rewards of our hard work!,6621
Z23,Battles are like exams. Earning MVP is like getting the top score on a test.,6622
Z23,*sobs*  No I mustn’t cry,6622
Z23,Take this!,6623
Z23,I've got to find a way out of this mess,6623
Z23,"Studying is important! A wise man once said ""knowledge is power.""  France is bacon? Jeez just what is going through that head of yours?",6624
Z23,You’re a bit tired? Very well getting rest is important. You want a lap pillow? I guess it’s fine just for a little while,6624
Z23,"(Off to the side of the stacks of paperwork on your desk you found a box of chocolates and a note left by Z23 that reads: ""Your hard work is always appreciated."" Since you were both working overtime late into the night she never got a good opportunity to give it to you directly before she went to sleep on the couch You now to give her your thanks after she wakes up.)",6625
Z23,Once we complete today’s mission then come back and confirm our schedule for sorties over the next few days there are still many things left to do.,6625
Z23,Well done let’s keep this up everyone!,6626
Z23,Whew Sorry to keep you waiting. I was having a hard time deciding which outfit to wear Ah um how do I look?,6626
Z23,You look so cool and hardworking like that Uh ahem! Disregard that! A-anyway would you like a light snack?,6627
Z23,Wait if you're going to do this kind of stuff at least save it for after work! Even if I like I mean err d-disregard what I just said!,6627
Z23,Instructor how many points did my combat performance score? Heheh just kidding~,6628
Z23,I-I'm all right but I'll have to train more after we get back,6628
Z23,This is going to be on the exam! If you don't take thorough notes I am going to punish you!,6629
Z23,Have you memorized this? This part's going to show up on the test. If you don't pass you'll,6629
Z23,Afterwards let's get something to eat. It's on me. Consider it a reward for all your hard work today.,6630
Z23,If there's a part you don't understand speak up and ask.,6630
Z23,P-playing pranks on your instructor is prohibited! *blushes*,6631
Z23,What we analyzed earlier sure came in handy!,6631
Z23,Javelin's boxed lunches look really good! I should ask her to teach me how to make them like she does!,6632
Z23,Laffey? Laffey! Wake up! Good grief how do you manage to fall asleep while playing volleyball?!,6632
Z23,Wh-what do you think you're doing?!,6633
Z23,Be it ballgames or combat I won't let anyone beat me!,6633
Z23,Darn I need more practice,6634
Z23,Ugh how am I supposed to keep smiling all day long? My jaw's gone stiff already,6634
Z23,So if you order this set you can choose from one of these or these. Not a bad deal eh?,6635
Z23,Hmm I should really take this opportunity to learn some new recipes. Oh sorry this is your menu~,6635
Z23,I've been smiling a lot more lately?  Well that's because you've gotten so much more respectable.,6636
Z23,The four of us: Laffey Javelin Ayanami and I Who would have thought we'd all become such good friends?,6636
Z23,I'm doing splendidly today.,6637
Z23,What can I do?  I don't want to get my dress dirty.,6637
Z23,Eugen is going around teasing and feeling up the café employees again Ugh it's giving me an upset stomach,6638
Z23,Hatsuharu looks extremely nervous Maybe there's a way to soothe her,6638
Z23,What's up Yuugure? The kettle? Oh shoot! I totally forgot!,6639
Z23,Please try to keep quiet in the store! Why do Yuudachi and her friends always need to cause such a commotion,6639
Z23,More tea you say? Coming right up!,6640
Z23,Please don't try to imitate Eugen's bad behavior!,6640
Z23,Many of the Sakura Empire's sweets are made through steaming That's very interesting.,6641
Z23,If you're going to do something you've got to do it right! I'm aiming for the top!,6641
Z23,I don't mind balancing my work as both a manager and as an idol. As a matter of fact I think I might actually be well suited to it.,6642
Z23,I just remembered Laffey has an audition today so where is she?! Gaaaah!! Sorry I have something to attend to!,6642
Z23,Recently more and more girls have been asking me to become their manager. Jeez I have my own idol activities to take care of!,6643
Z23,Whether as an idol or as a warship I'll be the best I can be!,6643
Z23,Phew I'll have to work even harder.,6644
Z23,Miss Ranger what book are you looking for? Huh? Are you all right? Should I help find it for you?,6644
Z23,Ah go ahead and put that book inside that cardboard box. I'll take it over to Shiranui later.,6645
Z23,Laffey and Javelin don't seem to read much Mhm Ayanami and I will see if we can pick out some books that would be helpful to them.,6645
Z23,Might it be an order form? I'll check it in a moment!,6646
Z23,I'll handle sorting the books! I like doing it not to mention I'm also good at it!,6646
Z23,How tiring I should go take a break now. I'll have to check if Z26 and the others did their homework later,6647
Z23,I'm SO returning these kitties to Akashi Although I'd feel really guilty if I did that Ugh what's a girl to do,6647
Z23,Hey Z28! Stop treating the Meowfficers like pets! Look I know they seem like pets in more ways than one!,6648
Z23,Javelin and her friends aren't too keen about coffee. Heh that proves that they're still just kids.,6648
Z23,So that's where you're hiding! Gotcha! What? I'm totally not wasting time playing hide-and-seek with the U-boats!,6649
Z23,Wh-what are you trying to do?!,6649
Z23,Don't forget to keep your dorms nice and stocked up Just like these kitties,6650
Z23,Whether in battles or in missions or in studies diligence begets success!,6650
Z23,N-no way I lost the gear I worked so hard for because the upgrade failed and now I'm completely out of gold Ugh I'm going to have to go farm the dungeon all over again,6651
Z23,*sigh* I knew I should've made some extra preparations before chancing Akashi's upgrades,6651
Z23,You need a lot of money whether you're trying to reforge your gear or buying a new set How am I supposed to get that much gold anyway?,6652
Z23,I knew from the beginning that this might happen but still Ugh I hope I'm not going to be a complete liability to the others,6652
Z23,You think it'd be a good idea for me to class-change to Fighter? I mean I'm not as flexible as Ayanami!,6653
Z23,My DEF stat is solid enough. Look I have no problem fighting even in a swimsuit.,6653
Z23,I'll have to head back to the Guild to pick up another quest,6654
Z23,Ugh Why now of all times?,6654
Z23,Javelin that quest might be a bit too tough. Wait it's to cover my equipment costs?,6655
Z23,Jeez Laffey! Don't accidentally set our rewards on fire!,6655
Z23,New mail? I hope it's a quest invitation,6656
Z23,W-welcome back I'm still trying to get back what I lost Sorry Ugh I can't let myself cry over this!,6656
Z23,The commission rewards seem to have come in. Not that it'll solve this problem though,6657
Z23,Let's zone in everyone!,6657
Z23,I have to work harder to get gold and farm up a new set of gear!,6658
Z23,Ugh What am I supposed to do with this kind of gear,6658
Z24,Do you have any idea what time it is? This is why I can't stand you lazy mortals Get back to work already!,6659
Z24,A mortal that does not tremble before my visage? How strange I thought I did my best to look absolutely hellish I wonder why,6659
Z24,Black is the mark of my infernal nobility— yes black coffee dark chocolate and black forest cake are all things within my domain! Surely even human scum such as you recognizes this~♪,6660
Z24,Aaaahhhhh I'm sooooo booooored Shall I teach the next person who walks through these doors the meaning of true fear? No good? Tsk,6660
Z24,"The ways of the mortal realm have no bearing upon me! Therefore Zed I have no need for this ""homework"" stuff. Oww! F-fine I get it so stop chewing me out!",6661
Z24,You forgot to bring the offerings? Looks like I will have to teach you about the fragility of human life.,6661
Z24,These massive claws suit my status as an Archfiend both in terms of appearance and destructive power! Ahahaha!,6662
Z24,Surely you already know the fate of those who dare to disrespect me? Foolish mortal,6662
Z24,Impudent mortal how dare you wantonly touch my head W-wait don't stop please~,6663
Z24,Missions? Hurry up and get those unsightly things out of my sight mortal.,6663
Z24,The time of reaping seems to have come once more. Isn't that right human~?,6664

Z24,Commission rewards? I have no interest in mortal trinkets But oh! If there's any black chocolate or black forest cake you must bring it to me mortal!,6665
Z24,Not bad human scum! My power grows ever greater!,6666

Z24,Kneel before me! Ahahaha!,6668
Z24,Can I destroy everything yet?!,6668
Z24,Do you know the fate of mortals who have fallen to such depths of depravity?,6669
Z24,Nothing in existence can stand before me without succumbing to abject terror or so I thought. Why aren't you afraid of me!,6669
Z24,Are you offering this black forest cake to me? Ehe Ehehehe Very well human. Here ahhhn What are you spacing out for? Hurry up and feed me already!,6670

Z24,"Rejoice mortal for I bequeath upon you the chocolate of darknest night the very essence of my black soul! ""Z24 worked hard until late at night to make these chocolates?"" W-wait who did you hear that from human scum?!",6671
Z24,You liked my chocolate did you? Of course you would! I am the bearer of the mark of blackness – chocolate is obviously within my domain! Only those versed in the truths of darkness would You must go to a meeting with Zed? F-fine we'll continue this later then!,6672

Z24,Tell me what plans you have for the day mortal. I've decided – you shall bear witness to my dominion over this stadium and burn those memories into your eyes!,6679
Z24,When facing human opponents it would hardly be a fair contest if I didn't convert my claws into bandages It definitely had nothing to do with me breaking a whole bunch of racquets or anything like that.,6680
Z24,Not half bad for a human. It appears that the time has come to unleash my sealed power––,6680
Z24,Picking up balls is beneath someone as exalted as me! Oww! Fine fine I get it! Stop chewing me out already Zed!,6681

Z35,When it comes to the Iron Blood the cool one would have to be Z1. The sexy would definitely be Eugen. As for who is the most idol-like that would be none other than me the dancing and singing Ms. 35!,6711
Z35,Making chocolate is a cakewalk for an idol like me who can sing and dance! A chocolatewalk even! Have a bite! It's almost as sweet and sugary as me!,6711
Z35,Now I know for sure – my performances reach new heights when you're with me~ So to ensure you stick around I'm going to get you totally hooked on my chocolate! Wait you already are? Aww you know just what to say to make me happy~,6712
Z35,One of the prizes for this New Year's raffle is a sea mine raffle? Ehh I don't really want that,6712

Z35,I invited Z36 to come with me but why does she never take me up on it?,6713
Z35,What better way to kick off the New Year's celebration than with a Konzert! That's right!,6714
Z35,If I was to capture the various sights and sounds of the Sakura New Year's celebration and turn it into a show Ehehe might just be a great idea!,6714
Z36,"Ohh you came at just the right time! Hm want to listen to my brand new song? It's called ""Devilish Overture!",6715
Z36,Hmhmm~ what do you think about my bewitching heterochromatic eyes? H-hey! They're not contacts!,6715

Z36,Whether it's on the battlefield or on the stage once I release my sealed powers nothing can get in my way~!,6716
Z36,You'll get hexed for casually touching the Devilish Idol's body!,6717
Z36,Aldebaran has illuminated our path forward! Everyone the time to act is now!,6717
Z36,Phew Huff Why am I so worn out? Heh that's because I've been practicing my powers of bewitchment! Ahhh fine fine! I was practicing for my performance,6718
Z36,My long-departed kindred have finally returned to us from their commission. Let us greet them with hearts full of gratitude!,6718
Z36,My devilish powers of bewitchment have further awakened within me!,6719
Z36,Seal released! Come! I'll burn the power of a Devilish Idol into your retina! Shazam!,6719
Z36,This victory was ordained by the Fates! Yes that means it was inevitable!,6720
Z36,Ugh a Devilish Idol never loses!,6720
Z36,I'll engrave my devilish powers of bewitchment upon your body!,6721
Z36,Gah power overwhelming!,6721
Z36,My bewitching eyes have foreseen your imminent destruction!,6722
Z36,Heheh~ Finally someone able to see on the same wavelength as the Devilish Idol herself! Now become my fan!,6722
Z36,Heheh~ allow me to engrave the seal of the Devilish Idol upon your flesh! W-wait I'm not done making the stamp yet!,6723
Z36,Those who share the seal of the Devilish Idol shall have their fate cosmically bound with mine! That means I kind of like you! Ehehe~,6723
Z36,"This is the chocolate I made with Z35. We dubbed it ""Devilish Chocolate ft. Iron Blood Idols!"" Its flavors will abduct you into a realm of devilish deliciousness!",6724
Z36,Hmhm~ Are you hesitating to eat my chocolate because you're afraid of the power of my charm magic? You want to know whether my magic or Z24's power as an archdevil is stronger? Don't compare our powers when our world view isn't even the same!,6724
Z36,My bewitching eyes have seen the future! You will be so deeply moved by my chocolate you will offer me kind words hugs and even chocolate of your own making! Wait you'll actually do that? Yaaay♪,6725
Z46,This world is so different that from what I was expecting. How interesting!,6725
Z46,Z46 is but a codename not my actual name. For a ship something like a name should be unimportant but,6726
Z46,I have experienced neither failure nor suffering. Consequently I have accomplished nothing.,6726
Z46,A name is not merely a label. It is also proof that one exists in this world.,6727
Z46,The things I have yet to experience and understand are as numerous as the countless stars in the night sky.,6727
Z46,Being able to be touched is proof of one’s existence.,6728
Z46,If your desire is righteous then why do your hands tremble?,6728
Z46,Unknown beings and new acquaintances let us sally forth to meet them!,6729
Z46,Freedom and fortune only favor the hardworking.,6729
Z46,Receiving mail is proof of the expectations and trust that people have in you.,6730
Z46,Is the battle over or has it just begun?,6730
Z46,Waiting at the harbor for dispatched ships to return is something I’ve ever experienced before.,6731
Z46,Though this is but a trivial thing I'll return the favor for your consideration.,6731
Z46,For not fleeing upon seeing my visage I applaud both your courage and your stupidity.,6732
Z46,Am I too strong? Or are you all too weak?,6732
Z46,Go and boast to the world. Be proud that you have bested me even once.,6733
Z46,The unworthy are fated to drown in this world.,6733
Z46,What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.,6734
Z46,Perhaps what I seek cannot be found here.,6734
Z46,The journey to find a name has lead me to this place.,6735
Z46,Friendship enmity love hate these are things that I have never experienced prior to coming here.,6735
Z46,The sea breeze caressing my cheeks the crashing of waves resounding in my ear. The laughter echoing on the beach the footprints left in the sand. The rays of summer shimmering overhead the fluttering sails of ships about to return What an unforgettable scenery.,6736
Z46,"To be needed yearned for trusted and loved ""I"" am a cloth dyed by your color. My beloved please bestow a name upon me.",6736
Z46,My beloved I have long awaited this day. What name have you decided to bestow upon me?,6737
Z46,What need could there be to blush before me? There should be no need to repay this gift. Our relationship should be quite well known. What is so shameful about feeding you?,6737
Z46,Why are your hands trembling? You're the one who proposed we eat chocolate together and I learned from your lead that I should open my mouth to do so. Are you uncomfortable due to the difference in our heights? Then let's do this — I'll stand on this chair and you can face down toward me.,6738
Z46,"No blushing no shaky hands Evidence that you have accepted this current situation. This is perfectly normal and expected just as I read in that book about ""feeding chocolate to your lover."" Next I shall blush as I prepare for this sweetness to spread across my lips––",6738
Z46,The bustling beach clamoring with waves of joyfulness experiencing this kind of summer is a first for me but I don't dislike it,6739
Z46,The midsummer seaside is full of the unknown Let's go explore it together!,6739
Z46,The tide ebbs and flows leaving behind an unforgettable summer experience.,6740
Z46,The hot summer and the refreshing ice what a wonderful contradiction.,6740
Z46,Trust your instincts and your courage. They will guide you forward.,6741
Z46,No matter how many times I will always believe in your words. I can always trust that you will guide me down the right path.,6741
Z46,I truly do exist and am needed by everyone,6742
Z46,Why is there hesitation in your eyes?,6742
Z46,"Have you prepared yourself? Then let us proceed to our next battlefield. This battle shall thusly be dubbed: ""Soaking in the Shallows!",6743
Z46,"Through the sweat and tears striving for your goals. Rejoice in victory sink within defeat How fascinating this ""sports meet"" may be.",6743
Z46,I wish to run as fast as a leopard and fly to great heights like a soaring bird.,6744
Z46,"To compete with others and prove your worth through different means than fighting battles To be crowned ""champion"" 'tis a great feeling.",6744
Z46,Even in this little academy there are so many things to do and see,6745
Z46,Whether your sweat is falling on the track or your words are encouraging others all of this is an unforgettable experience.,6745
Z46,"Just a small piece of paper can create such a profound tie between people this ""scavenger hunt"" is more interesting than I thought.",6746
Z46,Where are your fingers Is there really anything worth exploring right there?,6746
Z46,Steel yourselves for this upcoming battle! Intense fights await at our next sports meet!,6747
Z46,Whatever color you may wish to bestow upon my existence – be it black red or blue I shall accept it all. My beloved please bestow upon me my name the identity you choose to bless me with.,6747
Z46,Dancing beams of light shimmering on-stage; uplifted voices joined as one by song Upon this unknown stage my heart doth flutter Yet this sensation is quite refreshing.,6748
Z46,As long as your eyes are fixed upon me; Upon this stage I shall sing bravely.,6748
Z46,Countless days and nights of hard work congeal into a single flash of brilliance onstage. Like a shooting star leaving only a fleeting trail of light—,6749
Z46,The star-lit stage is another world of its own an ajar door to the unknown that now beckons me,6749
Z46,My dear friend there is no reason to worry about me. All of this was made possible by Z23 Z35 Graf Spee Admiral Hipper We are all connected by the bonds of the Iron Blood.,6750
Z46,"Take heed of where the other performers and your audience are looking? I see. I understand why such a thing is important but can you explain to me why it is called the ""Evil Eye?",6750
Z46,My singing voice is proof of my existence.,6751
Z46,The stage is yet another battlefield where wars are fought not with steel and fire but with our charm and earnest desire.,6751
Z46,A commission fleet has returned to port. I wish for them to see me as I am now as a beloved idol.,6752
Z46,In front of tens and thousands of adoring fans I must do my very best.,6752
Z46,Let us sing this song of celebration; For our friends' displays of dedication.,6753
Z46,Have my lessons been so insufficient; or are my emotions simply deficient?,6753
Z46,Anxiety and nervousness gather along with the light upon this stage and the colors of my heart cannot be concealed O you who I love are these feelings reaching you?,6754
Z46,"Jianzhi"" the art of breathing life into works of cut paper is a world beyond my imagination. If these decorations are said to usher in blessings are they akin to a coat-of-arms or a holy seal?",6754
Z46,I eagerly await the completion of this next piece It's as if my soul resonates with this craft.,6755
Z46,The festival to herald the arrival of spring is sanguine filled with joy fanfare and deliciousness. None may resist its delights.,6755
Z46,Sister of my friend please wait a bit longer. The preparation process is difficult to control.,6756
Z46,After this piece is complete will you mount it? The more delicate the art the more strict the protection must be,6756
Z46,Allow me to complete this seal and it may be of great use to you.,6757
Z46,Are you trying to stick something onto me?,6757
Z46,I have no desire to be a burden upon my peers Before devoting myself to this craft I shall continue to observe.,6758
Z46,Cast your eyes upon this bit of dust. As I was entrusted with the cleaning I shall not allow this dust to remain. Will you also join me in this battle?,6758
Z46,Upon my pride this dust shall know no succor. Hm? Did I say something weird just now?,6759
Z46,Even Lord Bismarck's statue cannot be cleaned satisfactorily Too ashamed am I to face my Iron Blood friends but this war against dust I shall not suspend.,6759
Z46,How does one eradicate something as infinitesimal yet as innumerable as dust? It's impossible? That I cannot accept. To do so would invalidate my very existence.,6760
Z46,The process of making things beautiful and pure through cleaning is wonderful indeed. Call upon me if there is some place you want cleaned.,6760
Z46,"If dust is allowed to remain it will eventually become a mountain."" Does this not mean that all the dust I sweep will also become a mountain? I cannot allow that and that is why I must eradicate it all.",6761
Z46,The manjuus are doing their best to help out. I would appreciate it if you could do the same.,6761
Z46,Oh thank you. I was just thinking I needed a lift to reach that high spot.,6762
Z46,Hrmm The more I clean the more the dust grows. Will this battle never cease because dust yet remains on my tool's fleece?,6762
Zara,Welcome back. I've gathered everyone up and we're awaiting your inspection.,6763
Zara,Now Pola and I are often praised for our beauty but aren't you worried that all this ogling might cause some unsavory rumors?,6763
Zara,Tenacemente that is fighting to the bitter end no matter the odds is my personal motto.,6764
Zara,Looking up at the night sky admiring the countless glimmering stars it's really nice actually. But it's better enjoyed from inside don't you think?,6764
Zara,Eeek?!  Ahem! There is more to me than my armor plating you know? Maybe you would like a taste of my guns as well?,6765
Zara,Is this mission giving you trouble? Here let me take a look.,6765
Zara,An exhausting mission was it? Why not relax with a glass of wine?,6766
Zara,Grazie! Now my main guns are an even greater threat to the enemy.,6766
Zara,I'm used to being flagship. All ships get into formation! Tiro!,6767
Zara,I've brought you victory and glory just as I promised.,6767
Zara,Ugh Don't make me recall the humiliation I endured that night!,6768
Zara,Don't think you can pierce my armor so easily!,6768
Zara,My armor will hold!,6769
Zara,Did you do your stretches? You don't want your legs cramping up in the water.,6769
Zara,Hey no horseplay in the pool!,6770
Zara,Your eyes are wandering. Hehe what's on your mind? You can tell me.,6770
Zuikaku,Where are we going today? Pearl Harbor? Or perhaps the Coral Sea?,6771
Zuikaku,That Grey Ghost I’d like to duel her just once.,6771
Zuikaku,Shoukaku is so cute when she’s embarrassed!,6772
Zuikaku,Keep fighting until the last arrow is broken! That is what it means to be an elite!,6772
Zuikaku,Wait Grey Ghost don’t run away just because you won! Let’s have a rematch!,6773
Zuikaku,My least favorite food? Turkey of course.,6773
Zuikaku,Hmm Seems like the situation has taken a turn for the better!,6774
Zuikaku,So? Is it good news or bad news?,6774
Zuikaku,I’ll need you to perform some maintenance on me. Ah don’t forget about the planes either!,6775
Zuikaku,If only I had more planes!,6775
Zuikaku,As a perfected aircraft carrier I shall not lose to anyone not even to my seniors or to the Grey Ghost herself.,6776
Zuikaku,A never-ending swarm of enemies? I’m already used to it.,6776
Zuikaku,I am the auspicious crane after all!,6777
Zuikaku,Am I going to be sunk again?,6777
Zuikaku,As long as Shoukaku is with me~!,6778
Zuikaku,Shoukaku Is Shoukaku all right?,6778
Zuikaku,Seniors and juniors they’re all such a pain.,6779
Zuikaku,Whenever I feel irritated or lost training always makes me feel at ease. Yes I’ll definitely get stronger and catch up to that Grey Ghost one day.,6779
Zuikaku,E-eh?! Th-this is I’m not misunderstanding you right? Then um from now on I’ll be in your care dar darling? Waaah! Shoukaku is calling me!,6780
Zuikaku,This chocolate is full of my feelings so it should count as genuine But it also contains my gratitude for everything so Gaaah how am I supposed to know if it's obligatory or genuine anymore?!,6780
Zuikaku,I'm giving off a different vibe from usual? Hehe I'll take that as a compliment! As a matter of fact I do like trying on different outfits from time to time for a change of pace.,6781
Zuikaku,Akagi isn't exactly a fan of these large gatherings Wait could she be antisocial?! Err that doesn't seem right,6781
Zuikaku,Uhh So you wanted to compare mine to Shoukaku's after all?,6782
Zuikaku,This is nothing compared to Mikasa's hellish training! I'll be done in no time!,6782
Zuikaku,Zuikaku advancing!,6783
Zuikaku,Victory is assured as long as I'm here!,6783
Zuikaku,Oh Shoukaku was also doing this job right? Even though she's also wearing the same outfit she gives off completely different vibes than me,6784
Zuikaku,"Hmm I just can't pull the look off as well as Shoukaku Is this the difference in our ""girlish appeal?",6784
Zuikaku,Is this job just to sit here for the photo ops? I thought I'd get to drive,6785
Zuikaku,Phew! Keep it together Zuikaku You've gotta look your best in front of the camera!,6785
Zuikaku,Hold this position a bit longer? Mm can't I ask for a slightly cooler pose?,6786
Zuikaku,Ugh Having to hold this pose for so long is making my shoulders stiff,6786
Otto_von_Alvensleben,What's your deal? Oh I know! You're madly in love and now you can't take your eyes off me? You should've just said so~,6787
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Wrong document. Not this one either. Where is that damn ARGHHH! Now they're all out of order!,6787
Otto_von_Alvensleben,You keep a bunch of spare uniforms around don't you? 'Cause if you get splashed by a wave during a sortie well Heehee♪,6788
Otto_von_Alvensleben,W-wait time out! Y-you can't be serious about this right?!,6788
Otto_von_Alvensleben,What are you even trying to do?,6789
Otto_von_Alvensleben,This mission should be a cakewalk for you no?,6789
Otto_von_Alvensleben,You STILL haven't touched your mission rewards It's nearly been a whole day now!,6790
Otto_von_Alvensleben,You're really so helpless you need your secretary to fetch your mail huh W-wait didn't I get this just a minute ago?,6790
Otto_von_Alvensleben,How was your sortie? The breeze didn't get to your head did it? Good to hear.,6791
Otto_von_Alvensleben,The commission team has returned. Aren't you going to check what they brought back?,6791
Otto_von_Alvensleben,In a real rush to make me stronger huh? Heehee♪,6792
Otto_von_Alvensleben,I don't have time to waste on you small fry.,6792
Otto_von_Alvensleben,I could do this with my eyes closed.,6793
Otto_von_Alvensleben,How could I have messed up so badly?! This has to be some kind of mistake!,6793
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Think you can keep up with me?,6794
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Nobody warned me the enemy was THIS strong!,6794
Otto_von_Alvensleben,*sigh* This is all you've got? You're nothing like the stories claim.,6795
Otto_von_Alvensleben,I wish we shipgirls could all move underwater like submarines. Still better to move freely on the water than to be stuck on land like you. Heehee~,6795
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Hey! Who left this thing lying in the corridor? Someone could trip and get hurt! I don't need your help! I'm not some klutz who stumbles everywhere she goes!,6796
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Hey why don't we go on a date today? Did that really throw you for a loop? Hah I knew it would W-wait you have a list of spots to go? You prepared all that in advance?! Ugh Okay you got me this time,6796
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Whoa whoa whoa! This is WAY too sudden! I-I mean not that I don't want to No that doesn't mean I don't mind! Ugh You're obviously teasing me but why am I fine with that?!,6797
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Well well if it isn't you. Are you gonna try to impress me with your hustle again?,6797
Otto_von_Alvensleben,A table of contents Not a bad idea. I can sort them according to their listed order and W-wait my labels are all wrong?,6798
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Being the secretary's easy! Whatever problems come our way you solve them Come again? Oh I'm not saying my hands are free not at all!,6798
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Wh-what are you driving at?,6799
Otto_von_Alvensleben,I already know there's no beating you,6799
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Hmph! You really think this brainless trap can keep me entangled forever? I don't need your help! I can break free by myself! Umm what the hell? Why can't I do it?!,6800
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Grrr Once I find out who's behind this prank they'll have hell to pay!,6800
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Why are you just standing there watching me? Is this funny to you– watching me struggle trying to break free?,6801
Otto_von_Alvensleben,There's a sign outside warning people to stay away because of traps? S-someone must've put that up AFTER I got ensnared! There's no way in hell I didn't see it!,6801
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Hmph. This isn't a problem if I imagine it's a quirky hammock. I'm resting here that's all Ugghh G-get the sun out of my eyes,6802
Otto_von_Alvensleben,St-stop shaking the vines!,6802
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Th-th-there's a line and you've crossed it!,6803
Otto_von_Alvensleben,You finished a mission? So? What's that got to do with my situation?,6803
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Yeah you've got new mail But do I look like I'm in any position to fetch it for you?,6804
Otto_von_Alvensleben,Had your fun? Hmph I can tell you've been messing around with a bunch of girls.,6804
Otto_von_Alvensleben,No other choice– gotta fight like this!,6805
Jade,For how organized your room is there sure is a lot of dust everywhere. Look here and over here. Do you even know how to clean properly? Get to work already. I'll supervise you~♪,6805
Jade,What do you want? I'm busy talking with my friends. If you need help ask someone else~,6806
Jade,I thought I saw something weird on Juustagram but turns out it was just you. Since I'm such a good girl I will gladly share something with you: you made a typo here. Haha~♪,6806
Jade,I am a good girl so I would never call you a lowly creature or anything. See? I didn't.,6807
Jade,Shake hands? Sit first doggy! Hehe I'm kidding~♪,6807
Jade,Hyah?!,6808
Jade,Yeah I'm short. Got a problem with that?,6808
Jade,I'm a good girl so I'll do it with you~ It as in your mission~♪,6809
Jade,Your missions are done. Oh my did you not notice?,6809
Jade,What's in that letter? No nasty gossip about me hopefully?,6810
Jade,What's the matter? I have plans with friends so I don't have time for you. My now that you mention it I haven't congratulated you for your efforts yet. Too bad! I need to get going right now~♪,6810
Jade,The commission team's back. Think they brought souvenirs?,6811
Jade,Thank you! Heehee~♪,6811
Jade,I'm a good girl so I'll give this fight all I've got~♪,6812
Jade,Heheh. Lick my shoes. Go on stick your tongue out~,6812
Jade,Tch. How annoying,6813
Jade,This ought to do it~♪,6813
Jade,Why'd this have to happen to me?!,6814
Jade,You're rude and a huge jerk so I'm sure nobody else likes you either. Heehee~,6814
Jade,*sigh* Why must this happen to me Hm? Don't worry about it. I'm just looking something up for the greater good. It has nothing to do with you of course.,6815
Jade,Well I'm not surprised. I've known for a looong time now that you were preparing for this behind the scenes. Sooo what if I told you that I'm not interested? Haha I'm kidding~♪ Would you be surprised if I told you I'm totally into you too~?,6815
Jade,Where are your documents? I dunno~♪ Unlike Elbe I'm a good girl so I'd never play pranks.,6816
Jade,Hrmph Are you comparing me to Elbe?,6816
Jade,Umm,6817
Jade,I was ready to make you write a letter of apology if you neglected me any longer but I suppose I'll let you off this time.,6817
Jade,A congratulatory present? Aww were you looking forward to getting something? Hmm? Did I say I'd cook for you? I dunnooo,6818
Jade,I don't remember asking you to pat me on the head you know?,6818
Jade,What might I do if you don't pay attention to me~? Aww you don't have to worry so much. Have I EVER done anything to cause trouble for you? Heehee~♪,6819
Jade,*lick* Hmm. The fact that you can just stand there must mean that you don't mind the heat. It's okay though. If you don't come in I'm more than happy to have this pool all to myself~♪,6819
Jade,Be careful not to get heatstroke okay? You'll worry everyone if you collapse especially me.,6820
Jade,Wow everyone's swimsuits are so wild Hmph. What's wrong with something a bit more innocent like mine?,6820
Jade,Go go~ You're almost done! Do a good job and I'll *slurp*~♥,6821
Jade,Ahaha~♪ Ehehehe~♥,6821
Jade,Aren't you hot? Why not jump in the pool and cool off? I'm not like Elbe so you don't have to worry about manners or anything.,6822
Regensburg,Hey you're right on time. I wonder if you were born dutiful or if someone had to whip it into you... Either way get to work.,6822
Regensburg,Well well. So even you have a hard time handling my rigging. Unsurprising a mere human cannot tame its great power. Heehee.,6823
Regensburg,(Roooar...) What Regina? Is it feeding time? Shouldn't you be taking a break as well?,6823
Regensburg,Our balance sheet is... What kind of operation are you running here? Don't tell me you think it's okay to overlook such wastefulness.,6824
Regensburg,Every faction has its own ways of breaking in their rigging. It's something you also might want to pick up on just in case. Even if they won't help you fight they might come in handy some other way.,6824
Regensburg,Want to try petting Regina?,6825
Regensburg,Someone needs to be disciplined...,6825
Regensburg,Wha?!,6826
Regensburg,Let your superior do the fighting and in the meantime you may do your so-called missions. It's decided then.,6826
Regensburg,Rewards? Shame you won't get the chance to hoard them. Hahahaha!,6827
Regensburg,We've got a new message. What did Eisen break this time Regina? ...Oh it's something else?,6827
Regensburg,Tch putting me through all this... No I'm not talking about you. This is a problem between me and my rigging.,6828
Regensburg,(Roooar!) Silence Regina! ...What's that? The commission team is back?,6828
Regensburg,Heheh. Are you sure you want to consolidate my power at the top of the food chain even further?,6829
Regensburg,Deploying rigging! Now tremble in fear!,6829
Regensburg,(Roooar!) Now do you understand where you sit on the food chain?,6830
Regensburg,How could I lose to this... trash?!,6830
Regensburg,Roar Regina!,6831
Regensburg,I shall not... be defeated by lesser beings!,6831
Regensburg,In the end you humans deserve to be on the collar side of the leash. Know your place!,6832
Regensburg,Hahaha! I never thought it would be so funny to see an inferior being pushing their luck. Do not misunderstand; me disciplining my rigging and you giving me orders are two very different things.,6832
Regensburg,You're not half bad for a human. Even I acknowledge that which is why I deign to obey your orders. What of it you ask? I hope you don't think of me as below you in anything but name only.,6833
Regensburg,I won't accept it... I won't! I refuse to believe that commands from someone like YOU would draw out more of my power—What? You say this is your power not mine? No... Do you mean to say... You're stronger than me?!,6833
Regensburg,Kh! Why am I... unable to refuse a lower being such as you...? Damn it how did you become... stronger and more superior? ..A ring? Do you mean to tie me down?!,6834
Regensburg,(Roooar!) I've been waiting. I already know how dutiful you are. Go on; get to your next job.,6835
Regensburg,I don't need your help. Relying on you any more would soil the name of Regensburg– stop trying to help without my permission already!,6835
Regensburg,What? Did you get spooked by the smaller riggings again? Hmph. Regina you ought to know that your appearance is meant to symbolize the might of a superior being...,6836
Regensburg,Looks like my piggy bank is full again. Hmph don't underestimate savings. Every little bit counts and every penny saved is a penny earned!,6836
Regensburg,Kh...! This frustrates me to no end but...!,6838
Regensburg,Missions? Hmph I'll help you. It'll make me stronger too.,6838
Regensburg,The commission team is here. It's time to do your job.,6839
Regensburg,Good. Draw out even more of my power!,6840
Regensburg,Wanted to feast your eyes on this didn't you? Haha there's no point trying to deny it. All your petty desires are clear as day to me so why not just be honest about it?,6841
Regensburg,Hehe even someone like you is powerless before my allure. Those ruled by their emotions are easy to control just like riggings.,6842
Regensburg,Hm? What are you trying to... Hyeep?! G-get your hands off my tail this instant! Didn't you hear me?!,6842
Regensburg,(Rooooar...) Looks like Regina's gone pretty far out to sea. Hope it doesn't run into any trouble.,6843
Regensburg,Since you're here at the beach surely you have a thing or two you'd like to do? Come on let yourself loose already.,6843
Regensburg,(That's right! Bare your weaknesses to me as I pretend to be subservient...!),6844
Regensburg,Huh?! Wh-why do you know where my weak spot is...?!,6844
Regensburg,A job? What job could be more important than enjoying your time off at the beach?,6845
Regensburg,One can never get enough rewards. Same is always true regardless of what form they come in.,6845
